       "   'reviewText': \"The most incredible game ever forged by the hand of man or the gods that is Ocarina Of Time just became better.When done right Zelda is not simply a videogame but akin to having a religious experience.Well like its predecessor Link To The Past before it all it seems that Ocarina ever does is the right things to move the Zelda series forward.If only Eiji Aonuma had never been born, then Zelda's progress would not of taken 200 steps back from this epic acheivement in gaming and human history that was and is The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time.As a hero character Link has so much untapped potential and marketability it is ridiculous and yet as a character he is horrifically and pathetically mismanaged by Aonuma and underutilized by Nintendo.Link and the Zelda series deserves far better than this clown Eiji Aonuma and I hope to either a loving god/s or even an uncaring universe that one day justice is served and Eiji Aonuma FINALLY is removed from the Zelda series development along with the entire Zelda team which he assembled after OOT which he selected who share the same sick ideas he has about what the series is supposed to be.Well moving on to the rest of my review...Ocarina Of Time has become better with this edition to re-iterate a previous point.And NO its betterment is not owed to Nintendo's atrociously horrible 3D idea but rather because of the beautiful graphical reworking the company has done to an already good looking game that really held up in appearance quite respectably since it's original 1998 release on the Nintendo 64 home game console.Also owing to its superiority when compared to it's previous incarnations is how much more functional and fluid the game has become due to the accompaniment of the 3DS's dual screen feature which allows you to access items such as the iron boots much quicker than could be done in the past on the home console versions of the game.In anycase though this greatest game of all time is often criticized by fools and traitors ie Aonuma Zelda fans and related Nintendo damage controllists for having a mostly empty Hyrule field, yet the fact of the matter is the Hyrule field in this game is the greatest ever created since the series conception only rivalled by The Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past's version of Hyrule.A testament to the ridiculously pleasing design of the field is that despite all of these long years passing as videogames became increasingly sophisticated, powerful with awe inspiring graphics Zelda OOT's Hyrule field is still preferred over the newer &#34;Aonuma Zelda&#34; Hyrule field in Twilight Princess and thats despite the Aonuma Zelda title's field being filled with far more action and things to do in general.This speaks to the superiority of Shigeru Miyamoto and others as Zelda directors and the utter inferiority of Eiji Aonuma in that same position over Zelda.In anycase to touch on the dual screen functionality again I will say it really is quite incredible, it makes having to remember your Ocarina songs to trigger certain game actions such as warping to a new location or summoning your horse Epona into a thing of the past.Bottom line is this is a 5 star game.Reason being?Amazon's system won't allow me to rate it any higher.Buy this game!Especially so if you've grown up never having experienced it before.You'll soon see how inferior Eiji Aonuma's so called &#34;Zelda&#34; games are in comparison.The man is a hack that MUST be fired from Nintendo, he and his Zelda team for the series to ever produce a game at or beyond Ocarina Of Time's level ever again.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I've been a fan of The Legend of Zelda series since 1999.  Much later than some whom have been there since the beginning, but still a good long stretch of 14 years.  I purposefully avoided as much information as possible about this game except for a single early video of the Eastern Palace, and I'm glad I did.  With my new Zelda-edition 3DS XL, I was immediately slapped in the face by the bright, vibrant colors of LBW.  The 3D effect is used wonderfully to make it feel as if you're looking through a window at the Kingdom of Hyrule.  And I'm really glad I upgraded from the standard 3DS to the XL.  It was the perfect time.The game starts off simply enough, giving you a choice between two dungeons.  And then you get a choice between seven that you can do in almost any order.  I thought this was an excellent move to stray from the usual of: Get an item - get into the dungeon locked by its use - get an item in that dungeon - go to the next one unlocked by that item.  It was a system of long hallways with locked doors at the end of each.  That's all gone, and the items are all freely available from the start.  Just save up some rupees and buy as many as you feel you want.The various items greatly help in the way you can deal with enemy encounters, offering things like damage at range, damage to airborne enemies, flying ones, ones below or to either side.  You'll find you can deal with big shielded enemies by yanking the shield away with your Hookshot, or raising them up and roasting them with a pillar of fire, or dropping a bomb and using your own shield to keep them hovering on it to get caught in the blast.  Every encounter becomes a mini puzzle in itself rather than the Ocarina of Time style of Z Target, block with shield, hit with sword.Speaking of puzzles, LBW excels in not having strictly themed dungeons.  Most require a combination of skills rather than just using the dungeon's item.  It's more about thinking and overall skills and sometimes there's more than one way to do a puzzle.  The Desert Palace with the Sand Rod is an exception, but in general the areas seem more inventive and with a nice, large scale to them.  You feel like you're in a big place, changing parts of the level itself rather than finding a key to open a door to open another door.The dungeons are the main course of any Zelda game, but I found the sidequests enjoyable too.  My favorite is the search for the lost Maiamais, baby pink squids in shells hidden all over Hyrule.  Gold Skulltullas and Heart Pieces are nice, but there's just something rewarding about bringing the little guys back to their giant pink squid mom for her to upgrade one of your items, plus that adorable song in her cave.Speaking of music, LBW pretty much perfected it.  Ocarina of Time's soundtrack will be hitting me with joy and nostalgia forever, and Majora's Mask has an excellent and moody score, but if we're talking overall quality, it's got to be Link Between Worlds.  Some may say Twilight Princess did it better, but honestly I didn't really get into any of that.If there's anything negative to say, several dungeons feel very short.  I'd often find myself at the boss door with the key asking myself, &#34;Really?  Already?&#34;  But I guess that could be a case of time flies when you're having fun.  The bosses were also very easy.  I think only ONE was able to do me in.  For sure they were all enjoyable to fight, but a couple were just plain embarrassing themselves.  The wall merging trick made one particular boss a case of merge into wall, pop out, hit with sword, repeat.  You could literally go the fight without taking more than a few steps.  I wasn't asking for a series of grueling, punishing affairs, but more challenge would have been a good thing.  I never even needed to use any fairies (and also never found the net, so that could be a reason.)I could go on for a long time, but it's time to wrap this up.  If you're already a Zelda fan, you probably already have this or are just browsing reviews before ordering it.  To you guys: yeah, it's extremely fun and there's basically nothing here I'm dissatisfied with.  It exceeded every expectation.  To newcomers to the franchise: this might be the most condensed, pure essence of Zelda.  In fact, this might be the ideal first Zelda for a person.  Not too hard, smart and fun puzzles and enemies, excellent soundtrack and graphics.  The story is even better than usual!  Not terribly deep but a cut above the rest.Five out of five stars, no contest.  This isn't a 4.5 or a 4.9, it's a 5.0.  Buy it.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Bleary-eyed, two other people and I finally put this game down at around four in the morning, after a good bit over eight hours of play. In one marathon sitting, we had cleared the game, and were plowing into the bonus levels before we had to call it quits due to the fatigue that comes with sitting in front of a screen for prolonged periods of time. We laughed, we yelled, we gasped, and most of all, we had the time of our lives working together, competing head-to-head, and screwing each other over the entire time. As I almost passed out from my caffeine and adrenaline-fueled binge, many things were going through my head. But one thought predominately kept popping up, and after sleeping and dreaming of the game all night, it was cemented. \"Super Mario 3D World\" is not only perhaps the best game of this year, but the best Mario game since \"Super Mario Galaxy\", and the best Nintendo game in ages.Right from the beginning, players expectations are subverted. Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad are strolling along during a fireworks show and run into a clear pipe, which in turn leads them into stumbling upon a little fairy-esque creature called a Sprixie. It warns the heroes of the return of their old nemesis, Bowser, who is capturing these little things and keeping them in bottles (perhaps taking a cue from a certain warrior in a green tunic.) Before long, Peach leads the rest of the gang into the Sprixie Kingdom, and they task themselves with rescuing the entire race from enslavement by their perennial foe. That\\'s right, no princess to save, no Toads to free... even with how minimal of a role it takes, the story is very innovative by series standards, which sets the tone for the rest of the experience.That experience is, in a word, sublime. From the beginning of the first level, players know to expect something different from this game than they have historically gotten, with the introduction of a new power-up, new music, new enemies, and a new visual aesthetic. Unlike the past few Mario games, which have passed themselves off as \"new\", before eventually devolving into the same formula, \"3D World\" keeps upping the ante until the very end, to the point where players are being given new power-ups in the penultimate levels of the game. Even bosses which reappear act in somewhat different ways, and pose a bigger threat than before. Up until the very last stage, which is without a doubt my favorite boss stage in the franchise, and possibly one of my favorites of all time, players are kept on their toes, never feeling bogged down in repetition or formula.Which is a really nice thing to experience, considering the core gameplay itself is so ridiculously fast, fluid and fun. Giving a throwback to \"Super Mario Brothers 2\", or \"Doki Doki Panic\" if you prefer, each character feels incredibly distinct and have their own advantages and disadvantages. Mario is completely balanced, Luigi\\'s jumps are high and flutter, Peach can float, and Toad is blazing fast. Playing as all of them, it\\'s clear that no character is \"better\" than the other, but all of them have attributes which help them in certain situations, and if you\\'re gunning for all the stars and stamps in the game, you\\'ll actually need to become proficient with all four mains in order succeed. This prevents players from simply choosing a character and unquestioningly sticking with them, and forces them to experience the true variety that Nintendo has served up here.That variety expands beyond much more than the gameplay. As mentioned above, the sheer magnitude of how different each stage is becomes staggering as you go on, as levels consistently trick players into thinking it will be one thing, then switching it up. Eventually, elements of different levels are merged into single levels, leading to what can only be described as blissful chaos, especially when playing with a few friends. Giant waterslides atop the back of a familiar series creature, a level that references \"Super Mario Kart\" which exhibits speed that would put Sonic to shame, crazy Boo Houses that perform constant visual trickery... all of these stages are incredibly different, and not once did I feel as if I was doing the same stuff over and over again. Levels in certain worlds will even break the world\\'s theming, adding to this feeling of variety. Furthermore, this is the first Mario game where I thoroughly enjoyed every stage, and not once did I end a level with a feeling of disappointment.The new power-ups also lend themselves well to the environment of creativity. Sure, you\\'ve got your Fire Flowers and Tanuki Suits. But players are also given the Cat Suit, which allows you scale vertical walls and perform a deadly pounce. Then there\\'s the Double Cherry, which allows whoever\\'s playing to control clones of themselves. And even then there are level-exclusive power-ups, like mobile cannons, hats which let players blend in with Goombas, and lights that kill Boos and other ghost creatures. Add all of that in with other returning powers, like the boomerang suit and the coin block suit, and it becomes clear that \"3D World\" has truly mastered the art of the power-up, with none of them feeling extraneous in the least. Oh, yeah, did I mention you could hop into a giant ice skate and zip around? Because you totally can, and it\\'s freaking adorable.Right about now, this would be the part where I say, \"the graphics are good for a Nintendo game.\" Not this time. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 might have more advanced processors, but with what they have right now, players are given upscaled version of the same grey, black and brown color schemes they\\'ve been pushing for the entire seventh generation. Nintendo, on the other hand, has produced one of the most positively gorgeous games on the market, period. Bright, vibrant colors splash beautifully rendered and gloriously creative stages, producing a beautiful canvas that is a delight to gawk at. In fact, I would encourage players to take a few seconds out of the timed stages to simply look at the the beautiful visuals on display here. While some publishers and software developers are duking it out over what wartorn battlefield they can make look the most realistic, Nintendo has hands-down produced the most next-gen game in terms of visual prowess yet, outdoing even the beautiful \"Pikmin 3\" and \"The Wonderful 101.\"That goes double for the music, which isn\\'t just one of the best Mario, Nintendo, or game soundtracks I\\'ve ever heard. This is, with no hesitation, one of the best soundtracks produced for anything. Musically, the game is all over the place in terms of style, yet somehow it all blends together into an effective and forceful series of compositions. Uptempo jazz pieces go hand-in-hand with thrilling rock pieces that sound like they came straight out of the 80\\'s, and synthesizers which have a very New Age vibe transition flawlessly into hauntingly beautiful pieces of orchestral string music. A soundtrack has not impressed me this much since I heard the opening strains of, ironically, \"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\" back in 2006. This soundtrack is perfect for the game, but also stands on its own as a perfect work of art.Given that there are a few other games this year which have merited perfect scores from, I almost wish that there was some other scoring system for Nintendo\\'s newest title. Alas, there is not, and hopefully, my words will convey how amazing this game truly is. It is in a league of its own, up there with greats like \"Uncharted 2\" and \"Bioshock.\" This is unquestioningly one the greatest games ever published, proving that 16-player deathmatches, extensive downloadable content, and PC-caliber graphics are not what make great games. Not by a long shot.\"Super Mario 3D World\" has changed my standards for how I review games, and dare I say it, is easily one of the top ten games I\\'ve ever had the joy of playing. Young or old, veteran or newbie, this is an experience that has something to offer for every age and demographic. It is a purely sublime combination of innovation and fun, and is the definitive reason to own a Wii U.Score: 10 (Perfect)',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Disclaimer: no major spoilers.For over 20 years I've been waiting for a Zelda like this. My favorite game in the series is A Link to the Past, and this newest release is like that excellent game on steroids. In my opinion, the last great Zelda game was Wind Waker. The previous two home console games, Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, were very good but lacked the magic that gave me any motivation to play through them again, and the two DS games were average. Boredom kept me from even finishing Phantom Hourglass.This one is different though. I like the fact that the item acquisition and usage system has changed. You have access to pretty much everything from the beginning of the game, so no waiting until the midpoint of your adventure to acquire the hookshot like in all the other games in the series. All items are used and replenished through a magic-type meter that automatically replenishes itself, so no more need to roam around the overworld slicing down bushes to replenish your arrows and bombs. These two significant changes are a drastic departure from the typical Zelda formula, and it's a welcome change because it allows the player to focus more on the one thing that I always felt was one of the best parts of playing any Zelda game: exploration. Since you have access to most of the essential items from the start, the quest is not nearly as linear as it has been in the previous games, and this encourages one to just walk around shooting and blowing up stuff and seeing what happens. Even more so than A Link to the Past, the heart and soul of this game is very reminiscent of the original NES Legend of Zelda where you just walk around exploring and discovering things as you go along.One drawback that I hope Nintendo addresses in the future: I wish there were an option to turn off the hint system. At times, there's a little too much hand holding in the game, and while this may be necessary for a novice, if you're a seasoned Zelda veteran, it really does detract from the experience.I'm a little over halfway into the game, and I can say with confidence that A Link Between Worlds is at least in my top 3 favorite Zelda games of all time. Until I finish the entire game, I can't say for sure if this one will stand the test of time and beat out Zelda III for my number one spot. But either way, this game is a spectacular masterpiece, and if you have a 3DS you should go out and get this right now.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'No matter what angle you look at it from, this is a special game. What started out as a 3DS remake ofone of the greatest video games ever made, has quickly taken on a life of its own. Now, it\\'s a spiritual successor/sequel to one of the greatest games of all time, something that fans have waited over 20 years for. If I\\'m not mistaken, it\\'s also the first *traditionally-controlled*, top-down, 2-D Zelda game made exclusively by Nintendo sinceLink\\'s Awakening(my 2nd favorite Zelda game). The big question, then, is can The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds stand up to the hyperbolic hype and expectations that it released to? To put it simply, yes, it absolutely can. I have a strong feeling this one will be up there in the consciousness of most gamers in the long term. Not only is ALBW a nostalgic throwback for fans of classic Zelda games, it is a huge step forward for the series and full of brand new, pretty groundbreaking changes to the traditional Zelda formula. I will try to be concise and avoid overlong exposition, but this will be a long, detailed review, as I want to be as informative and helpful as possible; you\\'ve been warned. As of 11/24, I\\'ve beaten the game, having been playing this ever since picking it up at a midnight release party, unable to put it down unless I had to because of adult responsibilities and blah blah blah. I can confidently say that this game gives Zelda fans a cause for rejoicing. This is a true masterpiece!The story in ALBW may seem at first to be a retread of A Link to the Past. It takes place in Hyrule several generations after the events of ALttP. A new villain, named Yuga, has arrived on the scene. He plays a similar role to Agahnim from ALttP, turning the descendants of the seven sages into still paintings with his magic paintbrush staff, presumably with some nefarious purpose relating to Ganon. He himself can turn into a living painting as well. Very quickly, however, the story turns into something much bigger than you may expect. The Dark World concept returns in ALBW, but has been expanded to new depths. In fact, this game\\'s Dark World feels much closer to the Twilight Realm fromTwilight Princess, and especially Termina fromMajora\\'s Mask. This game\\'s dark world is actually an alternate version of Link\\'s world, with its own inverted Tri-force, a once brilliant but now forsaken kingdom named Lorule, and its own wise princess named Hilda. Of course, Link will set out to save both Hyrule and Lorule, and by the game\\'s end, he will have met with many twists and turns, as well as encountered many interesting and likable characters. I absolutely love stories that incorporate alternate dimensions/worlds that have their own different version of the same characters, and ALBW uses that plot device to great effect, in my opinion.The storytelling is exceptionally well done in this game, with cutscenes showcasing great writing and localization. New characters are really enjoyable, and the returning characters that are a staple of the series (Zelda, Impa, etc) all have interesting traits that make this game\\'s version of them unique. Hilda is mysterious and has a cunning wisdom, which is a nice contrast to Zelda\\'s warmth and sagely wisdom. As a villain, Yuga is a great balance between psychotic/creepy and silly. He is what you\\'d get if you put Lord Ghirahim, Agahnim, andKefkainto a pot and then threw in a dash of Ganondorf. Believe it or not, in terms of plot and the way the story unfolds, this felt more along the lines of the darker, moodier Twilight Princess and Majora\\'s Mask, and I love it. The ending is incredible. If you\\'re expecting \"just another Zelda story,\" you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised by how deep and interesting this one is.The visuals are something that may polarize some folks. The gorgeous concept art looks likeSkyward Sword\\'spainterly style meeting theOracle of Seasons/Agesdesign, but the actual in-game graphics looks more like A Link to the Past meetsThe Wind Waker. Character models have the \"Toon\" proportions of WW, whereas everything else, from scenery to character details, all has an undeniable LttP design. Personally, I think the game looks gorgeous (The Wind Waker is my personal favorite Zelda game). It\\'s quite detailed in places and very colorful, and there\\'s a ton of variety in the different locales. Rather than just being a recolor, Lorule actually looks quite different than Hyrule. Many landmarks are in the same place, but Lorule\\'s version are almost always startlingly different and fresh, and I really enjoyed that. Dungeons all have unique designs as well. There\\'s fantastic variety and attention to detail in this game visually. ALBW does an exceptional job of delivering that sense of discovery and adventure Zelda games are known for. It all runs at a smooth 60 fps too, which is great. When it comes to the 3-D visual effect, I didn\\'t think I\\'d use it much with this game but I love it! As gimmicky as it may sound, the 3-D effect really makes it feel like you\\'re getting a bird\\'s eye view into a living, breathing world. The dungeons feature more vertical designs, full of things that utilize the 3-D in very cool ways. You\\'ll see what I mean when you play. Overall, this is a splendidly beautiful game with many nods to Zelda\\'s past and a meticulous attention to detail.The audio is equally wonderful. Sound effects are very nostalgic, even down to the sound scrolling text makes. The biggest stand out with the sound, however, is the soundtrack. I don\\'t know what it is about 3DS games having exceptional soundtracks, but ALBW is no exception. Many classic tunes get a huge overhaul and sound stupendous. Rather than be the more string symphony you\\'d expect from a Zelda game, there\\'s quite a few brassy big band orchestra type songs, and I love it. Overall, though, the whimsical music sounds like it was played by a roaming band of skilled Minstrels, and I mean that in the best way possible. New songs fit in with the old perfectly and are just as good in their compositions. I LOVE Hilda\\'s theme, and it stands proud alongside other great modern Zelda character themes like \"Midna\\'s Lament\" and \"Follow Fi.\" Overall, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing, maybe the best Zelda soundtrack in terms of pure composition bliss since Wind Waker.The gameplay in ALBW can be divided into two categories: the nostalgic, traditional Zelda aspects, and the groundbreaking, new changes to the Zelda series\\' formula. Let\\'s start with the traditional aspects first: The game undeniably feels like a true-to-form classical Zelda adventure. You\\'ll be exploring a huge, fantastical world, with memorable temples and dungeons interspersed throughout. These temples are filled with unique, engaging puzzles centered around special items, with excellent (brand new) boss fights that are thrilling and challenging. You\\'ll be going to various towns, meeting the memorable characters living in Hyrule/Lorule, and undertaking interesting side-quests. All of these core concepts in Zelda are intact and at the top of their game in ALBW. Much of the overworld in the game is very, very similar to ALttP. The temples are in the same locations, for example, but the temple/dungeons are brand new on the inside, as are their awesome bosses. Some features of the overworld are quite different as well. Treasure chests, pieces of heart, etc. are all in new locations. So while the overworld map may make the game feel more like a remake than a sequel at first, you\\'ll find both Hyrule and the very different Lorule to be surprisingly fresh to adventure through. Again, this game feels like a true Zelda game, and all of the core aspects I\\'ve discussed here are wonderfully executed.So what is different, you may ask? For one thing, all special items are available from the get-go via a shop run by a new character named Ravio. These items range from series\\' staples such as the bow and arrow, to new items never seen before but that fit the series perfectly. They\\'re too expensive to buy early in the game, however, so you\\'ll be forced to rent one item at a time until you acquire enough rupees to buy them outright. If you die with a rented item in your possession, it will merely reset and you\\'ll have to go rent the item again. By the end of the game, you\\'ll own every item. Under this system, rupees take on a much more important role. Whereas in past games, I rarely ever used my rupees for much, acruing massive amounts for Link\\'s retirement instead, ALBW makes rupees a very valuable commodity indeed. I really like that. This new item system also means that the game is much less linear than past Zelda games. In theory, you can go to whatever temple you want in whatever order, as long as you know which item(s) will be needed for that dungeon so you can rent it. Some dungeons can\\'t be accessed until you have multiple items, but the game features a very nice fast-travel system that alleviates any tedium and frustration from trying to enter a temple, only to find out you don\\'t have the prerequisite gear yet. For the most part, I love this new item system. It allows for a lot of choice when playing the game, ditching the characteristic linearity past Zelda titles have had.The biggest addition to Link\\'s repertoire is the new ability of Link to become a living painting. At any point, you can go up to a wall, press A, and Link will go into the wall, depicted in a style very reminiscent of Wind Waker\\'s prologue. This ability is really neat by itself, but the way the developers designed puzzles around it is nothing short of brilliant. This game features some of the most clever, mind-bending level/puzzle design for a Zelda game in years. No joke. There are so many great examples of that, but I don\\'t want to spoil it, so I\\'ll just leave it up to you to discover the ingenious examples of this for yourself. Even bosses require you to take full advantage of this ability, and it is so amazing! This painting ability is also the only way to transport between Hyrule and Lorule, by way of thin slivers of teleporation in various walls in the overworld. Needless to say, there have been many times I\\'ve been incredibly impressed by the plethora of ways the living-painting mechanic is utilized. You truly have to think outside the box and I really love that. The painting idea is fresh, it\\'s engaging, and it\\'s absolutely brilliant. Bravo Nintendo!So the item-based system and the painting concept are the biggest new ideas in the game, but there are several others worth mentioning as well. All special items can be upgraded by finding and bringing the children of a massive squid-like alien (?) called Maiamai to their mama. Using this upgrade/collectible system, a bow that could shoot only one arrow can be upgraded to shoot three at once, for example. Very cool. It takes Skyward Sword\\'s concept of upgrading gear to the next level. The streetpass feature in this game is amazing. When exchanging streetpass with someone who also has this game, their uniquely designed DARK LINK will appear in your world to fight you. Approach him and you can enter a battle with him. If you win, you\\'ll win a certain number of rupees as a bounty. You get to design your own Dark Link for others to fight as well, determining which items he\\'ll have when other players fight him. The better stocked a Dark Link is and the harder he is to beat, the bigger the bounty you\\'ll win. I absolutely love this feature. It encourages people to use streetpass, and it does so in a meaningful way that doesn\\'t feel at all like a gimmick. I love that.So are there any issues with the game? Objectively, this game is about as close to perfect as they come, but there are some nitpicky things I noticed that I\\'ll voice for the sake of objectivity. For one thing, the game is pretty short by modern Zelda standards. If you play this through for the story alone, it\\'ll easily take you about 15-16 hours, and if you\\'re a completionist, 20 at most. After playing for roughly 17.5 hours, I had done and seen everything in the game, every Maiamai found, every piece of heart discovered, every special item and upgrade acquired, etc. Is that a huge problem? Not really. After all, the original ALttP has a comparable amount of content, but ALBW is so fun, this amount of time flies by. Another issue I had was with totally unbalanced difficulty. Since the new item system allows you to tackle the dungeons in virtually any order, there can be a rather uneven experience when it comes to difficulty. When I played, I went from the incredibly easy early dungeons straight into a water temple that gives OoT\\'s Water Temple a run for its money. Then I went to the equivalent of OoT\\'s Spirit Temple, another challenging dungeon. After that, I went to a temple that was super easy by comparison. Granted, this isn\\'t really a huge flaw, but I imagine a lot of people\\'s first time playing this game will be somewhat chaotic because of that, so I figured I\\'d give you fair warning. Finally, one more nitpicky thing: Link\\'s voice is kind of strange at first. At times it\\'s deeper like a young man\\'s voice, at others he sounds like a kid, and sometimes he almost sounds like a gremlin (lol). It took me a little while to get used to it, but I eventually warmed up to it and enjoyed it. It grew on me. Really, those are the only \"complaints\" I have with the game, and none of them are bullet points you\\'d use to knock the game\\'s score down, but it is good to keep these things in mind so you can know what you\\'re getting with the game.All in all, this is a truly special Zelda game. While it is a very nostalgic experience full of nods to the legendary ALttP and several other Zelda games, I actually find the exciting new elements and design choices to be what makes ALBW such a special game. To play a Zelda game with such an overhauled item system with massively increased level of freedom and openness, the brilliantly conceived/executed painting idea, as well as a plethora of other unique elements, has been a genuine delight. I love the Legend of Zelda series, it is my favorite in all video games, but ALBW truly feels special. Its changes to the traditional Zelda formula ultimately are much better and more meaningful than the ones in Skyward Sword are, and truly makes me excited for the direction the series will go from here. So do I recommend it? Absolutely. I enjoyed the game so much that I couldn\\'t put it down until I beat it once I started it (I did stop for food and sleep though, lol). After beating it for the first time, I wanted to jump right back in and start a new game, and that is incredibly rare for me to do. I\\'ve always been a 3-D Zelda guy (even though Link\\'s Awakening is one of my favorite Zelda titles), but ALBW has seriously won me over and I\\'d place it in my top five Zelda games, easily. I\\'d even go so far as to say it is another flawless Zelda masterpiece that stands proud right alongside its 20-year-old legendary predecessor. So buy it, get ready for an awesome new adventure between worlds, and go save, not one, but two magical kingdoms in need of a true hero of courage!',\n",

I cannot rate the console itself because I\\'ve never owned a Wii-U before (still been using the Wii instead), so once I get more games for it, I\\'ll get back and update this review here. That said, I have to say, I am very well amazed with the HD treatment of Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Spectacular visuals for a beautiful gem from the last decade.For those who aren\\'t aware, no, an HD remaster isn\\'t necessary to play a game on an HD monitor/telly. The thing is, then you\\'ll have to do with either grainy picture formats, crosstalk/ghosting, or the occasional rigid/cutting line effect on certain polygons. The last two are very common when playing a 480p game on an HDTV. I have to admit, when I was playing my Wii on my HDTV monitor, I couldn\\'t play without feeling \"letdown\" by the loss of quality on my experience, forcing me to have to use a 480p LCD screen or a tube-telly (stuff happens). So it\\'s always nice to have a great game have an HD remaster (Unless your name is Konami and you ruin Silent Hill 2 and 3).For those who never played LoZ: Wind Waker, the game was quite phenomenal, and very unique for it\\'s time. The Gamecube was capable of doing very quality graphics (as shown with Resident Evil REmake, Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 4, Blood Omen 2). A lot of people disliked the fact that Zelda went with the more cartoon route. Yes, the details/graphics aren\\'t as great compared to Twilight Princess. The thing with the cartoon-like detailing, is that it actually works. The environments are life-like/fluid, Link\\'s eyes paid attention to the environment, which in my opinion, was the best innovation. It\\'s very nice to see the game have an HD remaster.Comparison between the original Wind Waker and WW-HD on an HDTV. The original, on an HDTV you have jagged edges, and all sorts of off-looking colors. The quality of the game is honestly sub-par when compared to an older TV set, or a flat-screen computer monitor. In the remaster, I have noticed clearer visuals, and no jagged polygons. However, I have noticed a loss in some details, although for the casual person, you likely wont notice it. The HD remaster is also very cool in that it incorporates the goofy Wii-U Gamepad. If you get used to it, you\\'ll love that it shows the inventory screen, and you can drag and drop items to designated parts of the inventory. It\\'s very nice. Also, a new Hero mode, which looks to be a more challenging difficulty mode.For anyone who wants a collector\\'s bundle, or doesn\\'t have a Wii-U, I\\'d go for this bundle. What you get in the box is as listed-1: The Wii-U Zelda system/gamepad.2: An HDMI cable.3: A digital copy of Zelda Hyrule Historia book/timeline.4: Legend of Zeld: Wind Waker HD.For $300, it\\'s not a bad bundle.',\n",

Now I got the Wii U thanx too my computer expert buddy Jim I got homebrew in Wiimode of my Wii U using the smashstack hack not the twilight hack in case if ur wondering what that is: Before u get homebrew you have to go online with your computer go to Wiibrew.com These different types of hacks start with having either of these 2 games: Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess the Wii version or Super Smash bro's Brawl if your hacking Wii or Wiimode of your Wii U you will want either of these 2 games. So Super Smash bro's Brawl does the smashstackhack obviously and Twilight Princess does the Twilight hack. You can type in these names and Youtubers will give you more precise and legit instruction on how to get homebrew on your game console. So now that my friend was able too do that for me I had too figure out why my Wiimote plus wasn't working so I concluded with that the plus isn't compatible with homebrew apps so I bought a thirdparty unofficial Nintendo Wiimote from Rock Candy Wiimotes! I'm SUPER PROUD OF MYSELF! I DECIDED TOO TEST THE APPS ON IT AND SEE HOW MANY I CAN LOAD WITHOUT THE WIIMOTE SHUTTING DOWN! IT WRRRRRKS!!! SO I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT! THATS WHY I GAVE IT 5 STARS! Now I can play: Nemesis Gameboy, Wolfenstein 3D Gameboy Advanced-pc, Pokemon, Zelda, Super Mario, Space Station Sillicon Valley N64!\",\n",

Don't get me wrong I love the game, but after playing a bunch of PS3 and PC games for so long my eyes were very unhappy with the graphics of SS.  I looked online and found that this sort of cable would help a little bit and that's the reason I purchased it.The cable did help the graphics pop a little better and soon enough my eyes adjusted to the graphic limitations of the Wii.  I could have sworn Twilight Princess looked better than SS but they're about the same it seems.  The graphics are naturally kind of grainy.I would recommend this to anyone still using a Wii to help up the graphics to 480p.

       "   'reviewText': \"Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more. Basically you need all the items to complete the game such as The Ice Rod, Zora Flippers, The Magic Cape, Cane Byrna. There are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the 1 where you get the flute there is this old man & his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to Link & anytime you approach him he disappears it's cause he's dead. In The Dark World you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is Flute Boy cause he went to The Dark World & was killed. With this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place & this lost old man in the caves leading to Death Mountain & he gives you the mirror that can take you back to The Light World. This game is 1 of the 1st times I believe that Nintendo allowed death in their games. So the game started a dark tone in Zelda games. I mentioned the glitches & how they made this game feels fresh I tried them out there kind of funny like you can face Aghnim while you have Zelda with you & Aghnim is sending Zelda to The Dark World it's like you got Zelda out of her cell so who is Ganon sending to The Dark World. Plus you know it's night time when you start the game & it's raining well if you do the glitch where you beat the game in like 5 minutes then in the ending it's night time & it's still raining. My favorite glitch is where you have the mirror & The Moon Peral ok & you can keep going back & forth from The Light World to The Dark World near the broken bridge & you can explore The Dark World before you even face Aghnim the 1st time. Just make sure you have the mirror, The Moon Peral & The Master Sword. Stuff you have to figure out like how to get The Big Key or the item in each dungeon is great. The bosses were all good The Ball & Chain Trooper who is in the castle. To The Armos Knights which a lot of fun. The boss of The Desert Temple Twinmola it's a good pattern type boss. The Tower Of Hera Moldorm is annoying cause if it knocks you off the ledge then you got to fight the boss all over again. The 1st Aghnim fight is good cause you have to knock it's attacks back at him. The Dark World dungeon bosses are well done some are harder than others such as Arrghus, Mothela, The Blind Thief & Trinexx. The 1st Dark World dungeon boss isn't too hard Helmasaur King you just use your hammer bust away at the metal on his face & fire arrows at the middle of it's head. In The 2nd Dark World Dungeon you battle Arrghus who is a big eyeball surrounded by several small eyes which you have to use The Hookshot to pull the eyes away & slash away with The Master Sword until you have to fight the giant eye. Mothula in The 3rd Dark World Dungeon while difficult all you need is The Fire Rod to beat it. The Blind Thief is hard cause it has 2 or 3 heads attacking you. In The 5th Dark World dungeon you face Kholdstare which is kind of a pain. You also have to have the bird to get to The 6th Dark World dungeon & the boss is Vitreous who is sort of like Arrghus but not as hard. To get into Turtle Rock you have to have The Quake Medallion & to get through it you have to have The Cane Of Somaria. This dungeon is a big pain cause you have to light torches to open some doors & if 1 torch goes out then the door will close. The boss Trinexx in it's 1st phase where you use The Fire & Ice Rod's isn't hard when you fight in it's 2nd phase then it's more of a challenge & I recommend that you get plenty of red or blue potion or some fairies on hand for The Dark World dungeon bosses. When you beat The 7 Dark World dungeon youu free a Maiden & finally Princess Zelda. Which takes you to Ganon's Tower where you fight the 3 Light World dungeon bosses again & have the 2nd & final encounter with Aghnim. Which the 2nd battle with Agahnim is a little bit harder. The final boss is Ganon & Ganon is the hardest of any Zelda game cause it takes 4 Silver Arrow's this time instead of 1 & when stomps the floor the ends start to break off & if you're knocked off the ledge you have to start the battle all over again. I think A Link To The Past Ganon is harder than Ganon in The NES original or Ocarina Of Time. But when you beat Ganon you are treated to a great ending. I know this has been a long read & I said my next reviews for The Zelda games are going to be really long so just a warning. This game is amazing bottom line while love Ocarina Of Time & enjoyed Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess this still remains my favorite Zelda game. If you never played Legend Of Zelda A Ling To The Past you should & play it any way you can cause you will miss out on 1 of the best games of the 90's\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"This is something I rarely do review a video game oddly enough that's how I started off reviewing video games in late 08 early 09 on my older account. But lately I have been on a big Zelda kick the past 4 or 5 months I decided to review The Zelda games I own a while back I got a Nintendo 64 after my old N64 gave out after 12 or 13 years of service. Plus I bought a Gamecube to play Zelda Twilight Princess. So starting off I will review the original game The Legend Of Zelda on The NES. Released in 1987 not much story to tell on it cause it tells you the basic plot at the beginning. There is this Princess named Zelda who has been captured by Ganon who has came to this fictional country or kingdom whatever it is called Hyrule he wants this object of great power called The Triforce cause it can grant wishes if you wish for good things then good things happen if you wish for evil well evil things will go down. Ganon wants to take over the world what else. Zelda has broken The Triforce into 8 parts & there in 8 different dungeons & only 1 man can stop Ganon & that's Link or whatever you decide to call him. You start off & get a Wooden Sword most people go to the 1st dungeon but you can get 2 heart pieces & upgrade your sword. If you have full health then you can fire projectile's from your sword. There are different kinds of weapons you use to take care of your problems there is a bow & arrow which is in about every Zelda game except for Zelda II. A boomerange, bombs which can be used to blow open holes to make a passage way which that technique is used in a lot of Zelda games. You also have candles that let you see in dark rooms. When you get the wand & The Book Of Magic aka The Bible then candles become useless. You collect rupees which is the currency in Zelda to buy items. If you get up to 14 hearts then you get The Magical Sword a precursor to The Master Sword. If you have never played a Zelda game then there is a boss you fight at the end of each dungeon & if you are 1 of those people that haven't played a Zelda game then I don't know what's wrong with you you're missing out. The 1st boss Aquamentus is easy to beat especially when you have a real sword & it's even easier the 2nd time around when you have The Magical Sword. The 2nd dungeon has a boss known as a Dodongo which reappears in a couple more dungeons. In The 3rd Dungeon you face a Manhandla it does reappear in other dungeons. The Gleeok is the boss for the 4th dungeon. The 5th dungeon has a very easy boss called a Digdogger when you learn what to do it's the easiest boss in a Zelda game. Another sort of easy boss is Gohma it can be killed with 1 shot from your bow & arrow. Aquaments reappears as the boss for the 7th dungeon & Gleeok reappears as the boss for the 8th dungeon. Of course the last boss is Ganon himself & some say he's easy some say he's hard. Don't kid anyone he is difficult but not impossible. I'd actually say Ganon was hardest on A Link To The Past. Remember if it's your 1st time playing you need The Silver Arrows to kill Ganon. I always found it funny the names Nintendo gave to the enemies like The Skeltons are called Stalfos. The snakes are called Ropes. The Mummies are called Gibdos. The spider enemies are called Tektites & their mother spider is called Gohma. You also have different assortment of enemies like The Pol Voice, Vire, keese which are bats. Dark Nuts which I hate those things. Wizrobe's I hate those things too & Wallmaster's I really hate those things. You have these Centar creatures called Tynel's for some reason as a kid I though they were half human half dogs. Or those things called Peahats which as a kid I called them flying peaches or flying pineapples. The enemies always looked weird to me as a kid like The Pols Voice I called them I thought they were evil rabbits heads jumping around as a kid. The Zora I called devil fish. Bottom line is The Legend Of Zelda was fresh in 1986 & 87 cause of the adventure & puzzle solving. For the younger crowd who never played this game & have played the newer Zelda titles & decide to play any of the 2D Zelda games then you'll need a lot of free time & a lot of patience to complete it I don't care if you use cheats it still takes time to get through the game cause of all the time it takes to figure out dungeons. Next review for The Zelda games I own will be The Adventure Of Link Zelda II. Cause I did finally get the will power to beat it.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time must be one of the best games I have ever played in my life. I had this game when I was a kid, but never really played it. I saw this and thought \"Well, the only thing that would be \"different\" about this is the better graphics.\" I was wrong. The 3D, and Motion Controls literally make this game come to life. The 3D is breathtaking during cut scenes and boss fights, it makes the whole game come to life. With the motion controls you can move your DS to aim your bow, or look around, like you are really in the game. The graphics are also very spectacular, it even makes Wii Games look like an Eye Soar. I say the graphics are more on par with the Wii U.I don\\'t play many games, but I think this is definitely my new favorite game, even topping Super Mario 64 (My favorite game since I was 4). Once I got passed the first level, I could not put this game down, no matter how much I try to. The first level is a little boring, which may be why I didn\\'t play this game a lot when I was a kid (Never getting passed level 1). After you get passed level 1 however, things really get interesting, and make you want to know what going to happen next.People always argue Nintendo games are easy and have little to no challenge. Well, I really disagree. Though I admit, fighting most characters in Nintendo games is rather easy at times, there\\'s a ton of puzzles and mysteries in your surroundings that you have to complete. It took my a day to beat the 4th Temple, cant imagine how difficult the others will be.I always thought this game was overrated, considering its about the only major talked about Zelda Game, but its no where near overrated. This game is a masterpiece. Its the main reason why you should get a Nintendo 3DS if you don\\'t already have one. Even if you already own this game on the N64, or have a downloaded copy on the Wii from the Wii Shop channel, you should still consider getting this. This game went from great to spectacular, bringing such an unique story in a way you have never seen before.Thought the game is rated E10, if you are a parent checking this review, I don\\'t exactly recommend this game for younger Children. The game can have some really dark and scary moments, which may be why I never liked to play this as a kid. Even now that I\\'m 17, some of the things on this game still freak me out. The game is also just very complex, so you don\\'t really want your child complaining about being on the same level for a long time. If you are a parent searching for a game to get for your kids 3DS, stick with Super Mario 3D Land, or something simple and fun.Over all ratings for the game:Boss Fights: A: Some bosses are rather easy at first, but towards the end it really progresses. The 3D on the boss fights is also spectacular.Graphics: A+: I didn\\'t expect them to even be this great. Everything has really come to life. The graphics honestly look as good as a consoles.Controls: B+: Though the Motion controls are spontaneous, there is some parts where the camera is a little tricky to work with. Though that\\'s always a normal.Story: A+: This is definitely one of the greatest story lines ever. This is why I cannot cease to put this game down. Everything is so interesting, some scenes give me goose bumps. The story line is by far amazing, and reminds me of Lord of the Rings to a certain extent (Which may be why I\\'m so hooked on this game, being a huge Lord of the Rings fan and all)Gameplay: A+: This game has a lot of cool features. What I like the most is playing certain songs on an Ocarina to unlock doors, secret passages, and so on. I thought this was truly amazing, because I have never seen anything like this in a video game. The game play is original, unique, and fun, there is nothing boring about it.I think Ocarina of Time is one of the Greatest games to ever exist, and even though it was made in 1998, to this day it is still very much ahead of its time. I am in love with this game, it is also my very first Zelda Games, so I am planning to buy many of the other titles, such as Majora\\'s Mask, Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess, Wind Waker, and so on.So if I wasn\\'t clear enough already, buy this game. :)',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'I will always remember when I first learned that we got a SNES.  It was the summer of 1992.  Growing up in rural Oklahoma, my parents had a cow tank that we used for a swimming pool that we chlorinated.  I was in that tank all the time.  My father and my brother had gone to Oklahoma City (about an hour away from where we lived), and they had gotten an SNES, with \"Super Mario World\" prepackaged.  I immediately dried off, ran upstairs and my brother and I were immersed in Mario bliss.Being the Nintendo fans that we were, we were subscribers to Nintendo Power.  I poured over all the pre-cover of their latest [Nintendo] console, as well as any information we could glean of \"Super Mario World\".  I had even known some people who won the SNES in one of those give-aways they used to do back in the 1980s and 1990s on cereal boxes.  I was so jealous.Playing \"Super Mario World\" was a pure revelation that first time, and a perfect exhibition of the power of the SNES.  The graphics were gorgeous, the enemies were monstrous yet whimsical, and the Bullet Bills were enormous.There has always been a debate on which is better - \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" or \"Super Mario World\"..  For myself, I\\'d give the edge to \"Super Mario World\".  To be fair to \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", \"Super Mario World\" simply took the foundation laid by \"SMB3\" and perfected it, just like \"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\" did with the original \"Legend of Zelda\".Essentially, take everything great from \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", expand the graphics and audio from 8-Bit to 16-Bit, overhaul the level lengths and add a ridable dinosaur named Yoshi, include a lot of secrets, and wa-la!, \"Super Mario World\"!Everything \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" is so adored for, \"Super Mario World\" takes and does several steps better, with only one exception - suits.  \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" famously introduced us to Racoon Mario, Hammer Mario, Frog Mario, and Tanooki Mario (though oddly no Boomerang Mario, which we wouldn\\'t see until \"Super Mario 3D Land\").  \"Super Mario World\" only features Fire Mario and Cape Mario.  However, Cape Mario is able to fly for unlimited amounts of time, unlike Racoon Mario which is captive to a P-Meter and can only fly for short bursts.The story, always the same in the core Mario series, is simply that, while Mario, Luigi, and the Princess are on vacation to Dinasaur Land after the events of \"SMB3\", Bowser and his seven children kidnap seven dinasaur eggs and also abduct Princess Peach.  It is up to Mario to free the Princess and rescue the dinasaurs.  Don\\'t worry though, the story\\'s not important.  Mario is never about the story, it\\'s always about the gameplay.  And what gameplay it is!\"Super Mario World\" is famous for introducing the world to Yoshi, the ridable dragon.  Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride a dinosaur in the original 1985 \"Super Mario Bros.\", but was not able to implement this new character until this game.  It is strange Yoshi doesn\\'t appear in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"; after all, ridable steeds appeared in \"Adventure Island II\" and also the later game \"Little Nemo: Dream Master\". [Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshis - the basic green one, the blue one [(who, when swallowing any type of turtle shell]]Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshi, each with a special power according to their colour: green, red, blue, and yellow.  The green is the most common.  Upon injesting a turtle shell, the red blows fire, the blue flies, and the yellow creates a dust storm attack.  The green is able to do all of these, if he swallows the same color turtle shell (red = fire, blue = flying, yellow = dust).  The special color yoshis are only available in secrect Star levels, where they appear as babies which Mario must feed five enemies for them to become full grown.Yoshi is also famous for eating.  Strangely enough, Mario must punch Yoshi in the back of the head before Yoshi sticks out his tongue, looking for goodies.One of my favorite additions is just how Miyamota and company added to the lenght.  One legitimate weakness of \"SMB3\" is simply how short so many of the levels are - many times, you complete the level just when you feel you are about halfway done.  Even Miyamoto commented on this on one of the reissues of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", asking his developers if the game\\'s original levels were really that short.  Once a level is beaten, you cannot go back.  No so with \"Super Mario World\". Indeed, due to the secret exits and alternate paths, Nintendo encourages you to go back and explore levels already beaten, and the levels themselves are consistently much longer than those found in \"SMB3\".Taking the overworld map first introduced in \"SMB3\", for the first (and, until the 2012 \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", only) time on a home console Mario game, the map is connected and completely visible, unlike its predecessor.  Previously, the worlds were divided into individual maps, but not \"Super Mario World\".  From the get go, you could view the entire game map.  Dinasaur Land comprises seven different areas, played in this order: Yoshi\\'s Island, guarded by Iggy Koopa; Donut Plains, guarded by Morton Koopa Jr., Vanilla Dome, guarded by Lemmy Koopa, Twin Bridges, guarded by Luwig von Koopa; the Forest of Illusion, guarded by Roy Koopa; Chocolate Island, guarded by Wendy O. Koopa; and the Valley of Bowser, home to not only Bowser but Larry Koopa as well.You cannot underestimate how the world map truly effected gameplay.  For the first time on a significant level, you could choose your own path.  The map also afforded the game developers the opportunity to made the game chock-full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden areas.  The secrets were not so esoterically hidden to be inaccessible to the average player either - if a regular level had a secret exit, the level would be a red dot; if no secret exit existed, then the level is represented as a yellow dot.Each world is thematically diverse.  The first world features basic levels that ease the player into the gameplay, teaching you the rules and dynamics of Mario\\'s new adventure.  The second world is set in the plains, the third world is set in caverns, and the fourth world is set on dual bridges, along with some mountain levels.By the fifth world, the Forest of Illusion, the challenge has been ramped up, and to proceed you MUST find those deviously hidden secret exits.  We then have the \"tasty (but dangerous!)\" Chocolate Island, which also features a level that how fast you beat individual sections determines what the next segment of that level will be.  Then we have the challenging Ghost Ship (which, according to the instruction manual, is a wrecked ship from \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"), and the only boss level that Yoshi will enter. After that, naturally, is the Valley of Bowser.One of the best features are the two secret worlds - the Star World and the Secret World.  Unlike other Mario games, there are no warp zones present in \"Super Mario World\". However, there are levels called the Star Road, which enable you to get to different parts of the map quickly and effectively by accessing the Star World and completing the levels.  To connect the Star Road, you must find the secret exits.  Once you find the fifth and final level on the Star Road, you are then taken to the Secret World, a world of eight gruelling, ultra-challenging levels that will truly test your Mario metal.\"Super Mario Bros. 4: Super Mario World\" (the official Japanese title) is the best 2D Mario out there, though perhaps \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" will usurp this game from its lofty throne.Interestingly enough, Miyamoto has said that he was not entirely happy with \"Super Mario World\", as he felt the game had been rushed to publication and not completed to his exacting standards.  However, just like \"Mega Man 3\" (a game also apparently rushed), \"Super Mario World\" is as good as it gets.  I wonder what further changes Miyamoto would have made.  Unfortunately we\\'ll never know.Those who love masterpieces of excellent 2D platforming action would be amiss without this purchase for their SNES - and better yet, \"Super Mario World\" is also available on the Wii and Wii U\\'s Virtual Console.  Pick this one up!  You won\\'t regret it...-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games\\' development history.  Notably, Miyamoto said that \"Super Mario World\" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make.  As \"Super Mario World\" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on \"Super Mario Bros. 3\".  On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system.  This was my answer:]Let\\'s look at some Mario history, shall we?  SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that \"late in the NES hardware cycle\". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn\\'t they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There\\'s nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I\\'ve read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson\\'s Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that\\'s why they didn\\'t develop it for the Super Famicom.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I remember a close family friend of mine who is also an old school gamer and highly recommended this game to me. Which I asked him if it was OK if I could borrow his copy of the Twilight Princess. So he and I settled on a borrowing agreement he took one of my games to borrow and I took one of his games to borrow. Which in that case meant we would return the games we borrowed from each other (Its like renting a game from a video store only I was borrowing it from a friend and there was no late fee plus I am agreeing on a handshake to return his property in the same condition he gave it to me and if theres any damage I pay for it.) So I took the game home, tried it out and I immediately was immersed and in total love with the game. This game is by far one of the best Legend of Zelda games I have ever played.  My playing experience and ratings for the game which include graphics, storyline, side quests are as follows:Graphics 5/5 starsStoryline 5/5 starsSide Quests:4/5 StarsNot every single side-quest was terribly hard. The Poe Soul Side quest however is the hardest side quest because there is over 60 Poe Souls.  Because what I find difficult about the Poe Souls is a.) there locations b.) Knowing when you got them and not going back to the same location twice when I was already there.So yeah that's why I took one star off for that particular side quest because the locations for all the Poe souls can be confusing and I kind of wish that Nintendo would have lessened the amount of Poe souls and dropped it down to like 30 or 40. 60 is way too many for me to handle. But otherwise I love the darker atmosphere the bosses, the storyline and the graphics and my favorite part of the game is the Master Sword. I love they included that sword in this game just like they did in Wind Waker and other Zelda games that I know and love as well. This game I highly recommended die heart Gamecube fans as well as fans of the Wii.\",\n",

It came on time, case is in very good condition, manual is in pristeen condition, and disc is lightly scratched but is to be expected. But as for its working condition no problems at all. I bought this game because it sounded interesting and having had almost no experience with Zelda games before but watched others play it I had to check it out. I love this game I've been playing it nearly non-stop. I like the mix of puzzles to figure out as well as plenty of bad guys to fight and unique challenges in defeating foes or just trying to complete a mission. I also like this game in particular because there are some unique features that make it even more fun and interesting, such as riding your horse which you can name, turning into a wolf at different points in the game witch give you a whole new set of moves and abilities and not to mention a new perspective of game play and how is that not just really awesome? Also graphics are very cool and it's challenging but not so difficult that you can't eventually figure out what to do. I'm not very good at puzzles but I've gotten them after a while of thinking and searching. The booklet gives you tips and tells you controls and info about items. So what are you waiting for find this game you'll really enjoy it!\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Just a reminder: to play this game, you need the Wii MOTION PLUS remote and a NUNCHUK. You won't be able to play the game without those, so be sure to get them. A normal Wii Remote won't work. It has to be a Wii Motion Plus remote. And don't forget the Nunchuk.If you've never played a Zelda game before, I'll very quickly bring you up to speed. In almost every Legend of Zelda game (including this one), you play as a boy named Link who must rescue a girl named Zelda from the forces of evil. Link uses a sword as well as other items to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. This particular game takes place before all of the other Zelda games. That's pretty much all you need to know.The controls have proven to be a point of contention for some players, so I'll discuss them first.To swing the sword in this game, you swing the Wii Remote in the direction that you want to slash it. If you swing the remote horizontally from left to right, Link will swing his sword horizontally from left to right. If you thrust the remote forward, Link will thrust the sword forward. And so on.In some cases, you are required to slash the sword in a specific direction to hit an enemy's weak spot or activate a switch properly.This allows for a much more immersive experience than seen in most of the previous Zelda titles. It can be exhilarating and fun, but it also has the potential to be more challenging, and in some cases, frustrating.You really need to make sure that your Wii Remote is properly calibrated. You can re-calibrate it any time by pressing 1 to reach the gear screen, then click the circle in the bottom left corner that has the picture of a Wii Remote on it, then follow the instructions on screen. You also should stay back from the TV a reasonable distance (at least six feet/two meters or so), or you will keep having problems with the remote not pointing where you want. In addition, if you have a lot of trouble, try turning off other nearby sources of wireless signals such as routers and cell phones. Some of these use the same frequency as the Wii Remote and could interfere with the calibration. Be sure to use good batteries in the remote, too.You shouldn't have to swing the remote around wildly to get the sword to do what you want. A fairly small flick in the desired direction is sufficient to swing the sword. You can definitely play the game while sitting down. The only times when I got really worn out from playing were during the more intense battles where I was swinging forcefully just from the sheer intensity of it.Aside from sword swinging, the Wii Remote and Nunchuk are used for other actions in the game, and I found it to be pretty intuitive and not too difficult to master. The sword swinging is the only thing that I thought was challenging about the control scheme.As for graphics, they did a great job of finding a middle ground between Twilight Princess's realism and Wind Waker's cel-shaded style. Skyward Sword is beautiful. They were going for an impressionist style, and as such, the graphics often have a dreamy, soft quality that's lovely to look at.My favorite aspect of the graphics, though, is how emotive the characters are. The characters' facial expressions are subtle, but very expressive. From Zelda's amused smiles to Link's anguish and even Groose's smug grins, I felt an emotional connection to the characters that was stronger than I'd felt in any past Zelda game.Finally, I just want to say a few words to those of you who are Zelda fans and have played many of the Zelda games already.I, too, have played most of the past Zelda games. I was really impressed with this game. In fact, I adored it. It's quite possibly my favorite Zelda game now, although Ocarina of Time is still way up there for me.I do want to say, though, that if you've played Zelda games before, it's quite possible that you have some expectations in mind. I have read reviews by other Zelda fans who were disappointed because some of these expectations were not met.My advice is to let go of these expectations if you can. The game lived up to MY expectations, but I didn't have many expectations to begin with. But I know that there are fans out there who are just expecting too much. There are some elements of past Zelda games that don't appear in this one. There might be things that were done a particular way in past Zelda games that weren't done the same way in Skyward Sword. Don't let that sour your experience.The basic things that you expect from the Zelda franchise, like fighting monsters, finding treasures, solving puzzles, and so on, are all there, and they are done very well in my opinion. So try not to feel disappointed if your favorite unique innovations from certain Zelda games were not included in Skyward Sword. It's still a fantastic, fun game.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The Legend of Zelda series is one of the greatest video game franchises of all time, if not arguably *thee* greatest. With each release, Nintendo has showed us the magic of journeying through Hyrule\\'s beautiful kingdom. Now, they have done it again, greatly injecting innovation into the tried-and-true formula of past titles. This is a Zelda game unlike any other, and feels all at once both an incredible nostalgic celebration of 25 years of history, and a wholly new adventure full of wild, awesome new directions. Get ready for a fairly long review, but please know that this is written from the heart of a young man who loves the series above most others in his favorite pastime.The story and characters present in Skyward Sword are very different among the other Zelda titles, despite the obvious recurring ones. I don\\'t just mean the amazing setting of Link\\'s home, Skyloft, a fantastical city floating above the clouds where everone is bonded to their own guardian birdlike creature, a loftwing. No, from the start, Nintendo truly changes almost everything of what you\\'d come to expect from a Zelda game. This is the earliest tale in the series chronologically, acting as a prequel, making way for Ocarina of Time\\'s tale to come. Zelda is not a princess here, just another common schoolgirl. She and Link have been best friends since childhood, and may even have feelings for each other (it\\'s pretty obvious, and incredibly touching. My wife and I were both pretty moved by it). In Skyloft, the local school is essentially a knights academy, the uniform being a tunic that is easily recognizable to fans of the series. After completing a ceremony to become a senior in his class (the senior tunic is, you guessed it, dark green), Zelda and Link ride together through the sky to celebrate. Out of nowhere, a malevolent tornado knocks Zelda to \"the surface,\" a vast, unexplored land below the cloud cover and once again, Link takes up the mantle of being a fated hero, destined to save the day. I\\'ll stop here, because this is virtually spoiler free and if I say more it won\\'t be. Just know that Nintendo has really changed up the formula of story and characters we\\'ve come to expect from the Zelda franchise, and as a result, Skyward Sword feels incredibly refreshing.Another immediately noticeable change is in presentation. The story is much, much more cinematic than Zelda has ever been. Cinematic shot angles are much more dynamic than ever before, character expression is stunning, animation is smooth and realistic, and the writing is just fantastic. If anything, this feels like a very intimate entry in the Zelda series, not just epic or grand like past titles. It\\'s a lovely direction for the Zelda series, if you ask me. The characters all come to life thanks to this presentation, of course, but the writing present certainly helps too. Each character has so much personality, and talking to each of them is a joy. Link is a somewhat distracted dreamer with his head in the clouds, loves to sleep, but has tons of courage and kindness, a true hero. Accompanying him in his journey is Fi, a new kind of companion to the series. Fi looks like a ceramic doll, her \"speech\" sounds likeGLaDOS, and is purely logic driven. She is amazing. Zelda is a strong-willed, tough tomboy of sorts, and very lovable. Lord Ghirahim, the new villain, is *extremely* compelling and creepy (Ganandorf makes no direct appearance). All of these characters, as well as the plethora of side characters, are written and presented beautifully.The art design and graphical implementation is awesome here. The game has married the art design of two past masterpiece Zelda title styles into one wholly unique direction. You have more realistic people and settings, like in the dark, matureTwilight Princess, but you also have the vibrant color and imagination ofThe Wind Waker, and it is a joy to behold. Nintendo EAD designed the game to look like a water color painting, and I must say, they did a fantastic job doing so. Draw distances are fairly short, and anything beyond is purposely blurred to look exactly like a water-color painting of the impressionist style, full of  brushstrokes of beautiful color. I am deeply impressed here. The Wii is a painfully underpowered system in comparison to its two competitors, but it is genius art design like this that shows why the Wii has had some of the most beautiful titles of this generation (Metroid Prime 3,Muramasa: The Demon Blade,Super Mario Galaxy,Super Mario Galaxy 2,Okami, now this game, the list goes on and on). To put it succinctly, Skyward Sword is one of the most beautiful games in recent memory, and that is totally thanks to the absolutely brilliant (and well implemented) art design.Koji Kondo and Hajime Wakai; any fan of Nintendo will instantly recognize these names as two of the greatest musical composers of video gaming. They are almost unrivaled as composers, writing some of the most iconic music in the entire medium. Koji worked as musical supervisor in this title (as well as composed the main theme and some other songs). Hajime was in charge of music composition. This may be, and I *do not* say this lightly, some of their very best work yet. The music here ranges from the entire spectrum of musical emotion: epic, intimate, touching, sad, meditative, dark, joyous, achingly beautiful, uplifting, goofy/doofy (for a certain character), anything you can imagine. Each theme, whether for an event, a character, a place, whatever, is absolutely perfect for its place and can greatly change depending on the situation. It takes something special for music to not only define the experience for any gamer playing the game, but also convey the emotion and thought its supposed to, and the soundtrack here does so perfectly. Like most Zelda games, Link acquires a musical instrument that helps progress the story (Ocarina of time had... well... duh. Wind Waker had a baton), here it is a harp. You can play it at any time, and when you do, you can actually accompany the beautiful background music of wherever you happen to be on the harp. That\\'s very, very cool. Great job Koji and Hajime! You\\'re amazing.The gameplay is what you\\'re probably the most curious about. Does the Wii-Motion Plus work? Yes, it does very well, for the most part. You\\'ll have to deal with calibration from time to time, sometimes actions won\\'t register the way you hoped, but it\\'s not too big a deal and doesn\\'t happen nearly enough to mar the experience. The 1:1 swordplay works pretty flawlessly once you become acquainted with it. Link will seamlessly swing his sword however you do. Horizontal, vertical, diagonal, it all works quite well. Pretty much every enemy you will encounter will require a different strategy to defeat, and I have found that the swordplay grows more enthralling with each hour I play (Boss fights are outstanding). It took me quite a while to get used to it, but I must say that this is truly the game the Wii was made nearly six years ago for. It\\'s about time. The quest items you\\'ll find are also a blast to use. They give you some new ones right off the bat, and they\\'re all awesome, feeling completely new yet appropriate for the franchise. Also, Link now has stamina that runs out as he climbs and dashes throughout the world (yes, Link can now sprint around if you\\'d like). Link\\'s stamina actually adds a small layer of strategic depth to the game, and the concept comes into play in many scenarios throughout the game. This gameplay concept worried me at first, but it\\'s actually really enjoyable, and implemented excellently.There have been several major shake-ups to the usual Zelda expectations we all had up to this point. Gone is the field-dungeon-field formula of past titles. Instead, here you have a hub world, the realm above the clouds, with Skyloft as your main town to visit. Here you can restock supplies, buy or upgrade your shield and other equipment using items you\\'ve scavenged in your questing rpg-style, and go on very personal side quests that feel very much likeMajora\\'s Maskdid, making for a character-driven experience. A great change of formula, one I was *very* skeptical about beforehand.You can ride your loftwing and drop to the surface world below at key rifts in the clouds. Here, you have more concentrated lands you can adventure through until you get to a dungeon/temple that will advance the story. The world below, and its temples, feel quite a lot like the Metroid series, andthe Metroid Prime Trilogyin particular. The land is more condensed and concentrated, feeling like dungeon of sorts by themselves, but as you acquire newer items, more and more dimensions will open up in those places as you revisit them. It\\'s a huge change-up to the Zelda formula, but one that feels surprisingly good. Having now beaten the game and played through all temples so far, I am amazed at the ingenuity of them (especially Ancient Cistern, one of the greatest dungeon/temples of any Zelda game from the past 25 years, no joke). Yes, you\\'ll be pushing blocks and shooting targets to open doors, but you\\'ll also encounter brilliant new puzzles. I mean, the puzzles are challenging and downright laugh-inducing in their ingenuity, and feel very satisfying when you figure then out. Combine this with the totally awesome new items, stellar swordplay, and ease of use and you get the feeling that every area feels like an innovation, in much the same way playing through Super Mario Galaxy 2 felt like standing before a firing squad of brilliant new ideas. I am downright astonished. I did not think it could be done, honestly, but this game really has reinvigorated the series through great change to the formula rather than refining it further like Twilight Princess did, and trust me when I say no one is more surprised than me.This is a brilliant game, even among the other entries in what has been for 25 years a brilliant series. It takes Zelda in a plethora of new directions, while miraculously feeling *exactly* like a true-to-form Zelda game. Color me surprised. If you\\'re a fan of Zelda, then you don\\'t need me to tell you to go get this right now. This series has some of the most diehard fans of any gaming franchise out there, but just for emphasis\\' sake, I proudly, and loudly proclaim that this game is incredible! Buy it, soar through the realms above, and dive to the vast, mysterious lands below and fulfill your destiny to save the world once again!* I know this review is quite long, but honestly, this game has so much that merits attention, the review could be much, much longer and still be appropriate. I will edit my review as I play through the game more if I feel there is something worth mentioning that I come across. However, I feel that this is a pretty good summary that hopefully gives you a good picture of the game. Seriously, go get it, like, right now. You won\\'t regret it.- Update after beating the game:After playing the game for roughly 50 hours I finally beat Skyward Sword. In short, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Each and every hour spent in this game was filled to the brim with brilliance and excellence, and not one single minute felt like boring filler that artificially extended the game. This feels like the Super Mario Galaxy 2 of Zelda titles, where there seems to be an exciting new gameplay/puzzle element at every turn. The story is incredible, with a lot of twists that genuinely thrilled and surprised me. This game essentially acts as an origin story for the entire Zelda series. Pretty much every element that you\\'re familiar with from Zelda games see their true origin here, and it is spectacular (I won\\'t give any spoilers though, you\\'ll be blown away when you experience it for yourself). I have to say that I have not been this entranced and enthralled by a Zelda game since Ocarina of Time and I am a HUGE fan of pretty much every entry in the entire Zelda series, so I don\\'t say that lightly. The music is among the series\\' very best, which by itself is a massive accomplishment. The graphics and particularly the art design are incredibly beautiful, some of the most gorgeous and brilliantly inspired of the past decade, despite the underpowered system it is on. Because of all of this, I was compelled to play this constantly until beating it, AND there\\'s a new game plus mode that adds substantially to the game as well! For fans of the series, this game is an immediate must-own. I give it the highest recommendation possible. I absolutely love this game, and I\\'m fairly certain most of you out there will too.*That\\'s my final statement. This is meant to finalize the points I made from my original review, which I think will be as detailed and informative as anyone would want or need. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Good day. :)- I wondered when the supply of first-edition copies of this game, which came with a special bonus musical CD, would run out and Nintendo would start reproduction of this masterpiece without the bonus disc. It appears now is that time. I wrote a very detailed review of the game when it first came out. It\\'s one of the reviews I\\'m most proud of, and I stand by my assessment. This game is just as good now as it was when it released about six months ago, and is just one of those magical games that must be played, as Zelda games tend to be. Having had months to think about the game since completing it for the first time, what really stands out to me about it is the spectacular art design and execution of said artistic concepts, the absolutely beautiful and moving soundtrack that I think is some of Kondo and Wakai\\'s best work, the exceptional story and the way it is told, the very unique and enjoyable temple/level design, and finally the unique gameplay and control mechanics. It\\'s a very moving experience when all combined together. Also, may I just say that Ancient Cistern may be, in every way imaginable, one of the very best temples/dungeons in Zelda\\'s rich 25 year history. Seriously, it\\'s fantastic, but in all honesty, the entire game is so incredibly memorable and endearing. So enjoy this review, and have a good day. :D',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'I got this disc about six years ago, when the GameCube was still a modern console. At the time, I paid $45.00 for a used copy, which even then was expensive. To this day, the price hasn\\'t gone down any, but I can assure you that, for any Zelda fan, the price is well worth the enjoyment you\\'ll get out of it.As the box says, this disc has 4 full games on it. It also has a demo of The Wind Waker, a short video retrospective, and a fairly useless tutorial about hoking up a Game Boy Advance to The Wind Waker (kind of irrelevant if the person doesn\\'t own the full game).The first game included is The Legend of Zelda, from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This game is the one most people remember, and considering the time when it was made, it holds up fairly well. If anything, it\\'s actually slightly overrated in my opinion, but it\\'s still a very good game.The second title is Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, also on the NES. While many people don\\'t seem to like this one, it actually is my favorite of the \"old\" Zelda games. Unlike the first game, even aimlessly wandering around has a purpose, as you gain experience points, grow stronger and learn spells in a very RPG-like fashion. The side-scrolling view also helps make it more action-oriented.The third game included on this disc, Ocarina of Time, is undoubtedly a classic. The graphics actually look a bit sharper here than on the native Nintendo 64 hardware, and the inherent control differences inherent in the system (familiar to anyone who\\'s worked with an emulator or the Virtual Console) aren\\'t as big an issue here as some games. Another good feature is that the GameCube controller has rumble built into it.The fourth game is Majora\\'s Mask. Similarly to Zelda II, I actually like this one better than Ocarina of Time, if only because it\\'s so different. Unfortunately, there are occasional sound glitches (which the manual and load screen list as due to the porting process), but these don\\'t detract from enjoyment of the game.Just as the game says, with this disc and the Game Boy Player, it is possible to play every entry in the Zelda series on the GameCube (except for Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Skyward Sword, and Link\\'s Crossbow Training). The games are:- The Legend of Zelda (this disc / Game Boy Advance)- Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (this disc / Game Boy Advance)- A Link to the Past (Game Boy Advance)- Link\\'s Awakening (Game Boy / Game Boy Color)- Ocarina of Time (this disc / Master Quest)- Majora\\'s Mask (this disc)- Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages (Game Boy Color)- Four Swords (Game Boy Advance)- The Wind Waker (GameCube)- Four Swords Adventures (GameCube)- The Minish Cap (Game Boy Advance)- Twilight Princess (GameCube)Overall, this disc is a must-have for any Zelda fan who doesn\\'t already own these four games.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is begging to be perfect. For many players, the game may seem perfect as they venture into it. And yet both the players and the game know it can\\'t be perfect. Still, SS is by far the greatest Zelda game since it has ventured into 3D with Ocarina of Time. Skyward Sword feels like reuniting with an old friend. Fans will instantly feel nostalgia as they journey both in and above Hyrule. Gimmicks like cartoon graphics and werewolves are tossed aside, as familiar mechanics are enhanced in complexity.Nintendo has never been very open about the Zelda timeline, but this title\\'s placement is clear: it is the first adventure. The first Link and the first Zelda have to team up to save a land that is yet to even earn the title of Hyrule. There are quite a few plot twists, and I\\'d rather avoid spoilers, so I\\'ll just touch on the start of the story. Link and Zelda are young students in a knight academy on a floating island, far above the clouds. Little do they know, they are both destined with huge roles in saving the world below, which is on the verge of destruction. The story is beautiful and deep, much more so than most Zelda titles.Story: 5/5The graphics are a breathtaking blend between that of Twilight Princess and that of The Wind Waker - cel-shaded but with realistic proportions. Environments are colorful and everything is incredibly detailed. The Wii was definitely pushed to its limits with this titles, making it a beautiful way to herald the end of the Wii and prepare fans for the Wii U.Graphics: 5/5The music surpasses the incredible graphics. All of the music is orchestrated, and even classic sounds (such as opening a chest) have never sounded so beautiful. The music CD is a great bonus, as there was a lot of work put into the music and the results are magnificent.Sound: 5/5The true meat of this game is the game play. As with other titles, this Zelda game is packed with puzzles. Even more prevalent than that is the combat, which has been escalated. The Wii Motion Plus allows the player full immersion, as Link swings the sword exactly how the player does. This freedom is important, as every small fight actually takes skill and concentration. An upgrade system takes weapons and items to new levels, and there are definitely quite a few memorable items. Unfortunately, there are a few flaws. Fi, Link\\'s partner who is meant to aid to player, becomes a nuisance as she points out every obvious detail. When she\\'s not stating the obvious, she\\'s reminding you how to complete tasks you\\'ve completed dozens of times or she\\'s giving you statistics that quickly get annoying (such as, \"There is a 70% chance that a key somewhere in this place will unlock this door\"). Areas are recycled a few times, making the game feel smaller than it is. These are just a few of the cons, but the pros vastly outnumber them and you will likely not notice most until a second play through.Game play: 4/5Replay value is a trick thing to access. This title is extremely long for a Zelda title. Chances are you will not decide to replay it right after beating it. However, a harder mode is unlocked upon completion, and chances are you will want to enjoy this game again. The length may lower the replay value, but you definitely get your money\\'s worth.Replay value: 3/5Also, this game should be considered family friendly, so the kids could join in, though it might not be easy for small children.Overall, this game is a must buy for fans and non-fans alike. This title is the peak for Zelda, and I can only wish Nintendo the best of luck in managing to top this one.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'With the benefit of retrospection, it\\'s easy to assume that this game may very well be the last of a pure type of Zelda breed.Skyward Swordhas come and gone, and has seemingly ushered in a new era of design ideas for future Zelda releases. That said, for those who believe thatOcarina of Timeis among the greatest games of all time, this is a game for you. For just as Ocarina of Time introduced an amazing template for a \"classical\" 3D Zelda experience, Twilight Princess took that template design and sharpened it to an unimaginable gleam. This is an incredible game, even today still, and now that it is a \"Nintendo Select,\" there\\'s no better time to get into it.The story in Twilight Princess really hearkens back to a classic Nintendo theme of duality. Much like the dual-timelines of Ocarina of Time, or the Light/Dark World ofA Link to the Past, there are two dimensions at play here. Link is a young man living in the peaceful, forested Ordon providence near Hyrule, in a small village. Here he lives a peaceful life with his fellow villagers, making a living on the famous Ordon Goat Ranch. Meanwhile, the light soaked kingdom of Hyrule has been invaded by beings from another dimension called the Twilight realm, their king a creepy villain named Zant. Zant\\'s plan is to combine his world of Shadow with Hyrule, creating a dark, twisted reality for him to control. One day, Link\\'s life is interrupted by this chaos, and once again, a young man clad in green will take up the call of destiny and stave back the sinister darkness that has fallen over Hyrule. He will also meet a shadow imp named Midna, who seems to be untrustworthy at first, but will come to be an awesome companion throughout the quest.It is immediately discernable while playing this game that this is a darker Zelda game than has ever come before it, with perhapsMajora\\'s Maskbeing the exception. Indeed, this is a gritty story, full of dark moments and even some more violent parts for a Zelda game (but still admittedly tame by industry standards these days). As with any Zelda title, you can count on the characters being likable, compelling, and charming. The writing of all characters, minor and major, is very well done, as is their design. Midna is worth mention alone. My all-time favorite companion character in a Zelda game (We even named our puppy after her :D), not only is she helpful, but her back-story is deep and her character is so well conceived and executed, she\\'s an absolute delight to have along on the journey. She\\'s a real stand-out in the entire franchise and that\\'s saying a lot! What helps make the experience so compelling is also the cinematic nature of the game. Though not quite as dynamically cinematic as newer Zelda offerings, Twilight Princess still boasts some really interesting cutscenes and story events. Yes, Twilight Princess is a great game in regards to its story and presentation.The art/sound design in this game is also very well done. After their grand cel shading adventure inThe Wind Waker, Nintendo took Twilight Princess to the extreme polar opposite, opting for a more \"realistic\" graphic novel-like approach for the visuals. Granted, this is a Gamecube game, albeit a gorgeous one, ported over to Wii, so don\\'t expect HD console graphics, but even having just beat this game for the fourth time last week, the graphics in this game are still beautiful. Link looks awesome, and to see many familiar elements of the series realized in this unique, realistic fashion is awesome. The visual splendor of the Twilight Realm alone is worthy of mention. This bloom lit world is filled with really beautiful particle effects and coloring, and is a real joy to behold. Imagine the way a sunset bathes the world in a warm, piercing light that makes everything look radiant, and that\\'s what the Twilight Realm looks like here. Very cool. The music is very well done too, as you probably already expected. Koji Kondo once again delivered. The music here ranges from haunting, creepy, atmospheric, lovely, moving, majestic, powerful, and everything in between. The only thing I wish they had done different with the music was to have some of it fully orchestrated, as the gorgeous compositions would have really benefited by it, but that is a minor gripe that only serves to further compliment the brilliance of the music itself. It really is a beautiful soundtrack.The gameplay is where this game takes Ocarina\\'s template, and expands upon it to new heights. Seriously, imagineOcarina of Time, and then grow its scope and size several times. You\\'ll be going on an epic quest across a ginormous Hyrule, exploring its massive field, its various regions, its several provinces, villages, and towns, as well as discovering its clever temples and dungeons. There\\'s a big emphasis here on horseback riding and combat. Some story events require it. The world here is really big, it would take forever to try and run across it all on foot. This huge space is utilized very well, hiding a ton of collectibles and secrets that true fans of the exploratory aspect of the Zelda series will love. The traditional Zelda gameplay is true perfection of the adventure game genre. The controls are fantastic, the puzzles and combat are incredibly satisfying, and, as you\\'d expect, the temples and their special items are a real highlight. It all comes together in a way that really pays homage to Ocarina of Time, every step of the way, even while expanding the scope to previously unseen levels. Other aspects of the traditional play has been expanded on as well. Link has many new moves that really makes him feel like a true warrior swordsman. Despite the fact swings are pre-rendered and merely activate with a waggle of the wii-mote, fighting in the game feels quite satisfying.Like I said earlier, there is a dual nature to the adventure here, and that expands beyond the story and into the gameplay aspects as well. You see, when Link encounters the Twilight Realm in Hyrule, because of his blessing by the goddesses as a true hero, he transforms into a fierce wolf instead of a mere wandering, lost spiritual flame like everyone else. This changes the nature of the gameplay quite a bit. Now you will use his sharpened senses to track scents, his teeth instead of his sword, his paws to dig in almost any spot, etc. It\\'s enough of a change from Link\\'s traditional gameplay to really make it stand out. This, combined with the shadow realm\\'s genuinely warm and beautiful aesthetics and equally unique musical queues and sound design help make this game\\'s own mark on the franchise. Later on in the adventure, you have the option to switch between normal Link and his wolf form at will, and the game design takes full advantage of this, adding yet another interesting dimension to traversing the temples.The Legend of Zelda is a spectacular series in video games, perhaps the greatest there is. Even with the benefit of over 25 years of retrospection, Twilight Princess is a very unique game that stands out. If considered in context of Zelda\\'s history as a whole, it is perhaps the most comprehensive, encyclopedic \"classical\" experience you could expect from the series, while also feeling like one of the most unique at the same time. Those may seem like mutually exclusive statements, but somehow Twilight Princess pulls them both off quite effortlessly. Skyward Sword has finally released, and greatly reinvigorated the series with massively ground-breaking changes. If it heralds a new age for the Zelda series like many believe, then Twilight Princess is the ultimate \"classical\" Zelda experience and a true relic of a fantastic era, and may well be for quite a while. If so, it is an excellent title that will no doubt continue to satisfy any gamer\\'s desire for even more years to come. Now that it is a Nintendo Select title, there\\'s no better time like the present. Buy it, adventure through the massive kingdom of Hyrule, and once again take up the mantle of chosen Hero and save the world of light.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'In the Wii\\'s final days, Nintendo has unleashed upon us The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, a landmark game and a high point in a console generation full of many high points.  Skyward Sword succeeds on a two fronts...it not only moves the Legend of Zelda franchise forward by creating an experience that is both looking towards the future and rooted in nostalgia, but it also makes the definitive argument for the viability of motion controls and their place in games that provide deep and engaging experiences.On the surface, Skyward Sword is a very different type of Zelda game.  Being the earliest game in the series\\' chronology, the game begins in a village in the clouds, and as the game progresses, Link explores various areas on the surface beneath the clouds, which are not laid out as easily navigable open spaces (ala Hyrule Field) but as areas consisting of multiple series of puzzles which gradually bring Link closer to the game\\'s dungeons.  It is much different from the more traditional structure of the excellent The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, but as gamers make their way through the game, they\\'ll begin to notice that as different as things may seem, this is one of the most nostalgic video games ever made, one that pays homage to the past 25 years of the franchise.  Gamers will see familiar characters reborn in completely different ways, and will get pulled into the games stunning environments and challenging puzzles just like they always have.  Skyward Sword feels like the culmination of every Zelda title ever made, and on the 25th anniversary of the first game\\'s release, it is appropriate that this game reaches new highs for the franchise.  The combat is the very best it has ever been.  The game is amazingly balanced...the overly frustrating puzzle elements of some of the previous games seem to be gone, yet the game is still very challenging, but more fair this time around.  The brilliant musical score is, for the first time, fully orchestrated and absolutely lovely.  Visually, this is arguably the most beautiful of all the Zelda games, with character models that seem to mix The Wind Waker with Twilight Princess, and a beautiful effect that makes background objects look like watercolor paintings as the draw distance increases.  And fittingly, the Zelda storyline reaches a level never before reached with the most emotionally poignant narrative the series has ever seen.  This is a story you won\\'t ever forget.The Legend of Zelda series has always been one to innovate, whether it is giving us the first true console adventure game (The Legend of Zelda), one of the earliest action RPGs (Zelda II), or the grandest 3D adventure to ever be created (Ocarina of Time).  Amazingly, Skyward Sword may be the most innovative Zelda title yet, and this is due to its unbelievable utilization of motion controls.  To list all the ways that the motion controls are creatively and meaningfully used here would not only take too long, but would spoil many of the surprises that come later on in the game.  But let me say this...this is a true, immersive motion gaming experience, far beyond the tacked on motion controls from the earlier Twilight Princess.  Not only do the controls work efficiently and effectively, but they significantly add to the experience of playing this game.  It seems like this is the game that the Nintendo Wii was born to have, and it is very surprising that it has taken this long for a game like this to come out.  Motion controls have been a controversial topic during this console generation, and their ultimate destiny in the gaming world is yet to be determined.  But if there ever was a game to make a case that motion controls can really be the ultimate way to control games that \"hardcore\" gamers like, Skyward Sword is that game.  You\\'ve never played a video game in this way before, and after Skyward Sword, you may never want to go back.So here, in the twilight of the Nintendo Wii\\'s life, we are given the console\\'s crown jewel.  Not only is it one of the finest of all the Zelda games, but it is also an evolution of the way we play games like this.  The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is a pivotal game this generation.  If motion controls become a major part in non-casual gaming, Skyward Sword will be remembered as the key launch point of this trend.  If motion controls disappear, Skyward Sword will always be remembered as its finest hour.  Regardless, Skyward Sword is another brilliant Nintendo gem.  An absolute must-play in every way.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword is potentially the most anticipated release of 2011 for any system maybe challenged only by The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim. With so much hype and pressure surrounding this \"swansong\" for the aging Nintendo Wii did this game soar or dive?Other than Super Mario the Legend of Zelda games have continually shown their influence throughout the gaming industry with game mechanics, story developement, and art design. However, some have felt that the Zelda formula that has been used in Zelda games over the past several years has gotten a bit stale, and needed to evolve in order for the series to continue to stay on top of the gaming industry.So, the real question is whether or not Nintendo has changed enough to keep things fresh, and whether Skyward Sword solidify\\'s it\\'s place amongst the top games of all time. The short answer is simple: YES!Gameplay: 10/10When the Wii was released we were promised true motion gaming with 1:1 controls for fluid gaming. Unfortunately, Nintendo was not able to deliver on this promise up front, and rectified this mistake by developing the motion plus to enhance motion gameplay. While Ubisoft was the first to truly test Motion Plus gameplay with Red Steel 2, which ended up being fantastic, Nintendo has now given the Wii the game it always deserved to showcase it\\'s motion control capabilities. Skyward Sword\\'s 1:1 sword combat is outstand. It uses a combination of motion plus and IR in order to keep things in check, and offers depth to the fighting mechanics that could have easily become redundant/repetitive. However, I found myself taking a look at the enemy I was approaching thinking about just how I was going to dismantle them. The added ability for Link to be able to sprint is also a major addition to the formula, which doesn\\'t necessarily seem huge, but allows for some significant gameplay changes. With the new quickswap menu for items/tools makes gameplay cohesive, and makes you wonder how you play Zelda without it. If you don\\'t find the gameplay delightful then you might be missing something.Story: 10/10Potentially one of the best stories of any Zelda title. Without giving to many details away, this is an origins story for the Zelda series. It doesn\\'t find Link and Zelda in their typical predicaments, which is a breath of fresh air for the series. You will also find yourself caring about other characters throughout, with the desire to try and talk with every villager in the game. Skyward Sword completely captivates, and you may not want to stop playing until to unveil it all.Graphics: 10/10The Wii released to prove one thing, and that was to convince developers and gamers alike that what makes a game soar is gameplay not graphics. I think for the most part they\\'ve succeded in that endeavor, but Skyward Sword is absolutely gorgeous to look at!  It uses a mixture of realistic graphics found in Twilight Princess, and more cel shaded graphics of Wind Waker. The final product is like playing a painting. It really is a work of art, and quite honestly one that only Nintendo could pull off.Longevity: 10/10With the main quest promising at least 40 hours of gameplay, and completing everything the game offers will put you potentially around the 100 hours mark. This game will keep you playing for quite some time. In fact it might even have you wanting to play through one more time just to see all of the beautiful locations Skyward Sword has to offer.Verdict: 10/10Skyward Sword is a constant reminder why Nintendo is #1. The way they create worlds, characters, and stories is really unique in the gaming industry. No one quite does it the way Nintendo does it, and with games like the Mario Galaxies and now Skyward Sword it just proves this even more. If you\\'re finishing this review then do yourself a huge favor. Either scroll up and purchase Skyward Sword, or run out to your local video game retailed and get it. People of all ages need to experience the greatest Zelda of all time, and quite possibly the greatest game of all time.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword was the most anticipated Wii game in this year (2011). Among Wii gamers, however, there are some debates going on regarding to this game. Is Skyward Sword the Wii's greatest game ever? Or is it a terrible game overhyped by many professional critics? Let me tell you what I think. After I played Skyward Sword about 10 hours, I still think the Super Mario Galaxy 2 and the previous Zelda game Twilight Princess are the greatest games that Wii has to offer. But that doesn't mean Skyward Sword is bad or disappointing. Actually, it's a great game!1) Story: This is probably the most distinctive Zelda game ever. Link lives in a city of sky called Skyloft, and he explores surface area as a visitor. As far as I know, Ganon who is one of the greatest video game villains doesn't appear in this game. Instead, there is a weird guy called Lord Ghirahim who is chasing after Zelda. Speaking of Zelda, she's not a princess but a childhood friend of Link, so Link and Zelda's relationship is closest compare to previous Zelda series.2) Graphics: One thing I really emphasize is that graphics are not everything for game. Sure, Wii doesn't have HD graphics like Xbox 360 or PS3, but many Wii games has their own unique style or beautiful presentations such as Super Mario Galaxy, Okami, Muramasa: The Demon Blade, MadWorld, etc. And these games are really fun to play! Same logic goes with the Skyward Sword. With the mixture of the Wind Waker's cel-shaded cartoon and the Twilight Princess' realistic style, Nintendo created Skyward Swords' own unique artistic style and texture. It has very colorful and bright atmosphere, and I don't think that is bad.3) Sounds: Like other Zelda series since Ocarina of Time, there is no voice acting in Skyward Sword. But, it doesn't bother me at all when I watch most of cutscenes. Link's companion Fi has very unique and artificial voice like GLaDOS from the Portal series. Very unique and I like it. The music? Wow! it's just stunning and beautiful. The orchestral background music is really suitable with the game's atmosphere especially when Link is flying around the Skyloft. Skyward Sword's background music is probably the greatest among the Zelda franchise.4) Gameplay: As you know, this game requires a MotionPlus or a Remote Plus. It heavily emphasizes 1 on 1 sword battle. When you swing your Wiimote, Link swings his sword exactly at the same direction although there are some misreadings or bugs. Of course, it is not easy to play it at the first time. Actually, it is hard to control especially when you fly or when you walk a rope. But if you have played Super Mario Galaxy series before, then you'll get used to it soon. There is also a new movement called dowsing which you point your wiimote on the screen to search someone, and I think this is a cool idea.Overall: Other than its unique art style and control system, Skyward Sword is a typical Zelda game. You explore the vast world, search items and walk around dungeons, beat dungeon bosses, do some side quests, and on and on. There is nothing really new or innovative game system, and it's not easy to control some certain movements. It is challenging, so you may need some time to get used to it. Yet it is very fun and worthwhile to play. It definitely shines the Zelda franchise. I highly recommend Skyward Sword to everyone who owns Wii.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Anyone saying this game is another Wii gimmick is dead wrong. Donkey Kong Country Returns using motion controls to roll was a gimmick. Mindlessly waving the remote back and forth in Twilight Princess was a gimmick. This game is what all Wii games should have been, it is just sad it came so late in the console's life.The control is flawless. It truly has to be played to be believed. I was worried about it at first, but it is so smooth and dead on, I don't see how anyone can complain. If you hate motion controls and refuse to use them in a game that actually does it right, then maybe try another game. I feel sorry for anyone so closed minded, because this really is the best Zelda game ever made. Comparing this to Kinect or any other motion-based game isn't even fair, because above all it is just truly amazing. This isn't about the controls, it's about outstanding gameplay.There are too many things to list why this is the best in the series. The storyline, the addicting upgrade system, the fact your wallet can now hold 10,000 rupees, the nonstop side quests from townsfolk like Majora's Mask, the long awaited sprint button (no more Bunny Hood just to go fast), the list goes on and on. Challenging bosses and difficult puzzles are so welcome after the cake walk Twilight Princess was. Every enemy is fun to face, and takes actual thought instead of mindless B mashing. The fact your shield can break from too much abuse means you can't hide behind it forever. Using the shield at the right times just gives the combat another boost in strategy, and hitting the nunchuk forward to knock an enemy back to go in for the kill still feels great.I can't stress enough how much fun this game is, and just how important it is to the series. Rupees finally have an actual use and don't sit in the wallet with nothing to really spend them on. All 3 shields have strengths and weaknesses, and can all be upgraded to 3 levels, meaning you always have a use for each one, instead of forgetting it's in your inventory once the better version comes along. The same goes for every item you obtain. Each is upgraded (bomb bags, deku bags, bug net, slingshot, everything) and can be swapped out to custom build your inventory through the pouch system. I mean this is what Zelda needed. This great layer of complexity to every part of the game adds so much to an already amazing gaming expierience. Without a doubt, this game is a 10/10.Please, give this one a chance if you have never played Zelda, or if you are a huge fan that's still worried about the motion controls. This is not Wii Sports. This is a massive adventure, where pointless waggling of the remote will not only look foolish, but get you killed. The controls are used for the right reasons, are responsive, and never feel forced. This game is beyond a masterpiece, it is one of the most important games ever made. What better series to change the face of the gaming world once again than The Legend of Zelda?Like Ocarina of Time, this is the new standard for years to come. The best Zelda ever.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'To say that Ocarina of Time was the best game ever made would not be a crazy statement. Sure Sony and Microsoft fanboys might not say it was the best, but at least they would respect it as a masterful game. \"Was\" the best. It almost feels wrong to say it, but Skyward Sword is of an equal echelon to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.Presentation / Finished Product:No glitches from what I can tell. Nintendo obviously did their part in thoroughly alpha, beta, and RC testing this game. I particularly enjoy the scores that have been implemented in this episode of the Zelda series. All seem to be fully orchestrated. It almost seems like they were trying to 1-up OoT. However, two things come to note: relative atmosphere and voice acting. While it is still excellent, SS does not have the same captivating atmosphere as does OoT. Not once did the music or SFX make me feel like I was thoroughly engrossed in the environments or temple-areas as much as I was in OoT. Dark, obscure, haunting atmosphere of the Shadow Temple? Flamboyant, active Fire Temple? Whimsical and mysterious Forest Temple? Not exactly. Again, it\\'s there, but I would have to go with OoT\\'s overall tone. On the graphics side, SS wins on style. OoT was merely a proof of concept that a Zelda game could go in 3-D (not to discredit it), but it is apparent that SS took a cue from Wind Waker and decided to craft its own artistic direction.EDGE: Ocarina of TimeGameplay:SS has plenty to do. From the typical gather items to improve your stats, to side quests, to the main quest, to an almost sandbox-like overland. The size of the world in SS is definitely a step up from OoT and much improves on the lack of activity density that the immense size of Hyrule Field had in Twilight Princess. The dungeon/temples are challenging and brought me back to OoT (I just flashed back to the Water Temple, sorry). The mini-games are back and each has their own interconnection, if you will, but I\\'ll let you discover that. I do take one bit of concern. The Wii-mote controls are very innovative. Finally, the enemies are smart and they just do not maintain the typical pattern of GUARD and STRIKE. No, they actually seem like they have a human-intelligence to them as to their attacking/behavior algorithm. However, while it is an improvement from the Wii-mote controls from Twilight Princess, I must say that I find myself growing tired of the 1:1 swordplay after awhile. Sure, it\\'s a great idea, and I hate to knock it down on its pretty much flawless execution, but I guess due to my own personal preference, it doesn\\'t exactly add a whole lot to the gameplay. To reiterate, the vastly improved enemy AI is a welcome addition, the 1:1 is remarkable, but in the end, I feel that it does not add too much.EDGE: Skyward SwordLongevity / Value:It\\'s really simple here. As with pretty much all Zelda games, there is a lot to accomplish and explore. While it is not exactly an open ended game, once you complete it there is a sort of satisfaction that is akin to... well... finishing Ocarina of Time. You feel fulfilled and sad and it is a bittersweet goodbye. It was a challenge (unlike Twilight Princess) and you will remember it as THE game. Skyward Sword is outstanding, however, I cannot shake this feeling that I am betraying Ocarina of Time with this following statement. I guess and old vet like me cannot believe it, but I would end with this:My mind says Skyward Sword is the fuller and richer experience vs. OoT.But my heart belongs to the Ocarina.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The Legend of Zelda series is one of the greatest video game franchises of all time, and arguably, it\\'s *thee* greatest. With each release, Nintendo has showed us the magic of journeying through Hyrule\\'s beautiful kingdom. Now, they have done it again, greatly injecting innovation into the tried-and-true formula of past titles. This is a Zelda game unlike any other, and feels all at once both an incredible nostalgic celebration of 25 years of history, and a wholly new adventure full of wild, awesome new directions. Get ready for a fairly long review, but please know that this is written from the heart of a young man who loves the series above most others in his favorite pastime.The story and characters present in Skyward Sword are very different among the other Zelda titles, despite the obvious recurring ones. I don\\'t just mean the amazing setting of Link\\'s home, Skyloft, a fantastical city floating above the clouds where everone is bonded to their own guardian birdlike creature, a loftwing. No, from the start, Nintendo truly changes almost everything of what you\\'d come to expect from a Zelda game. This is the earliest tale in the series chronologically, acting as a prequel, making way forOcarina of Time\\'stale to come. Zelda is not a princess here, just another common schoolgirl. She and Link have been best friends since childhood, and may even have feelings for each other (it\\'s pretty obvious, and incredibly touching. My wife and I were both pretty moved by it). In Skyloft, the local school is essentially a knights academy, the uniform being a tunic that is easily recognizable to fans of the series. After completing a ceremony to become a senior in his class (the senior tunic is, you guessed it, dark green), Zelda and Link ride together through the sky to celebrate. Out of nowhere, a malevolent tornado knocks Zelda to \"the surface,\" a vast, unexplored land below the cloud cover and once again, Link takes up the mantle of being a fated hero, destined to save the day. I\\'ll stop here, because this is virtually spoiler free and if I say more it won\\'t be. Just know that Nintendo has really changed up the formula of story and characters we\\'ve come to expect from the Zelda franchise, and as a result, Skyward Sword feels incredibly refreshing.Another immediately noticeable change is in presentation. The story is much, much more cinematic than Zelda has ever been. Cinematic shot angles are much more dynamic than ever before, character expression is stunning, animation is smooth and realistic, and the writing is just fantastic. If anything, this feels like a very intimate entry in the Zelda series, not just epic or grand like past titles. It\\'s a lovely direction for the Zelda series, if you ask me. The characters all come to life thanks to this presentation, of course, but the writing present certainly helps too. Each character has so much personality, and talking to each of them is a joy. Link is a somewhat distracted dreamer with his head in the clouds, loves to sleep, but has tons of courage and kindness, a true hero. Accompanying him in his journey is Fi, a new kind of companion to the series. Fi looks like a ceramic doll, her \"speech\" sounds likeGLaDOS, and is purely logic driven. She is amazing. Zelda is a strong-willed, tough tomboy of sorts, and very lovable. Lord Ghirahim, the new villain, is *extremely* compelling and creepy (Ganandorf makes no direct appearance). All of these characters, as well as the plethora of side characters, are written and presented beautifully.The art design and graphical implementation is awesome here. The game has married the art design of two past masterpiece Zelda title styles into one wholly unique direction. You have more realistic people and settings, like in the dark, matureTwilight Princess, but you also have the vibrant color and imagination ofThe Wind Waker, and it is a joy to behold. Nintendo EAD designed the game to look like a water color painting, and I must say, they did a fantastic job doing so. Draw distances are fairly short, and anything beyond is purposely blurred to look exactly like a water-color painting of the impressionist style, full of  brushstrokes of beautiful color. I am deeply impressed here. The Wii is a painfully underpowered system in comparison to its two competitors, but it is genius art design like this that shows why the Wii has had some of the most beautiful titles of this generation (Metroid Prime 3,Muramasa: The Demon Blade,Super Mario Galaxy,Super Mario Galaxy 2,Okami, now this game, the list goes on and on). To put it succinctly, Skyward Sword is one of the most beautiful games in recent memory, and that is totally thanks to the absolutely brilliant (and well implemented) art design.Koji Kondo and Hajime Wakai; any fan of Nintendo will instantly recognize these names as two of the greatest musical composers of video gaming. They are almost unrivaled as composers, writing some of the most iconic music in the entire medium. Koji worked as musical supervisor in this title (as well as composed the main theme and some other songs). Hajime was in charge of music composition. This may be, and I *do not* say this lightly, some of their very best work yet. The music here ranges from the entire spectrum of musical emotion: epic, intimate, touching, sad, meditative, dark, joyous, achingly beautiful, uplifting, goofy/doofy (for a certain character), anything you can imagine. Each theme, whether for an event, a character, a place, whatever, is absolutely perfect for its place and can greatly change depending on the situation. It takes something special for music to not only define the experience for any gamer playing the game, but also convey the emotion and thought its supposed to, and the soundtrack here does so perfectly. Like most Zelda games, Link acquires a musical instrument that helps progress the story (Ocarina of time had... well... duh. Wind Waker had a baton), here it is a harp. You can play it at any time, and when you do, you can actually accompany the beautiful background music of wherever you happen to be on the harp. That\\'s very, very cool. Great job Koji and Hajime! You\\'re amazing.The gameplay is what you\\'re probably the most curious about. Does the Wii-Motion Plus work? Yes, it does very well, for the most part. You\\'ll have to deal with calibration from time to time, sometimes actions won\\'t register the way you hoped, but it\\'s not too big a deal and doesn\\'t happen nearly enough to mar the experience. The 1:1 swordplay works pretty flawlessly once you become acquainted with it. Link will seamlessly swing his sword however you do. Horizontal, vertical, diagonal, it all works quite well. Pretty much every enemy you will encounter will require a different strategy to defeat, and I have found that the swordplay grows more enthralling with each hour I play (Boss fights are outstanding). It took me quite a while to get used to it, but I must say that this is truly the game the Wii was made nearly six years ago for. It\\'s about time. The quest items you\\'ll find are also a blast to use. They give you some new ones right off the bat, and they\\'re all awesome, feeling completely new yet appropriate for the franchise. Also, Link now has stamina that runs out as he climbs and dashes throughout the world (yes, Link can now sprint around if you\\'d like). Link\\'s stamina actually adds a small layer of strategic depth to the game, and the concept comes into play in many scenarios throughout the game. This gameplay concept worried me at first, but it\\'s actually really enjoyable, and implemented excellently.So far, I have been through three temples in about 20 hours (I bought my copy at a midnight release \"party\" and have been playing ever since). Gone is the field-dungeon-field formula of past titles. Instead, here you have a hub world, the realm above the clouds, with Skyloft as your main town to visit. Here you can restock supplies, buy or upgrade your shield and other equipment using items you\\'ve scavenged in your questing rpg-style, and go on very personal side quests that feel very much likeMajora\\'s Maskdid, making for a character-driven experience. A great change of formula, one I was *very* skeptical about beforehand.You can ride your loftwing and drop to the surface world below at key rifts in the clouds. Here, you have more concentrated lands you can adventure through until you get to a dungeon/temple that will advance the story. The world below, and its temples, feel quite a lot like the Metroid series. The land is more condensed and concentrated, feeling like dungeon of sorts by themselves, but as you acquire newer items, more and more dimensions will open up in those places as you revisit them. It\\'s a huge change-up to the Zelda formula, but one that feels surprisingly good. As I\\'ve said, I\\'ve played through three temples so far and I am amazed at the ingenuity of them. Yes, you\\'ll be pushing blocks and shooting targets to open doors, but you\\'ll also encounter brilliant new puzzles. I mean, the puzzles are challenging and downright laugh-inducing in their ingenuity, and feel very satisfying when you figure them out. Combine this with the totally awesome new items, stellar swordplay, and ease of use and you get the feeling that every area feels like an innovation, in much the same way playing through Super Mario Galaxy 2 felt like standing before a firing squad of brilliant new ideas. I am downright astonished. I did not think it could be done, honestly, but this game really has reinvigorated the series through great change to the formula rather than refining it further like Twilight Princess did, and trust me when I say no one is more surprised than me.This is a brilliant game, even among the other entries in what has been for 25 years a brilliant series. It takes Zelda in a plethora of new directions, while miraculously feeling *exactly* like a true-to-form Zelda game. Color me surprised. If you\\'re a fan of Zelda, then you don\\'t need me to tell you to go get this right now. This series has some of the most diehard fans of any gaming franchise out there, but just for emphasis\\' sake, I proudly, and loudly proclaim that this game is incredible! Buy it, soar through the realms above, and dive to the vast, mysterious lands below and fulfill your destiny to save the world once again!* I know this review is quite long, but honestly, this game has so much that merits attention, the review could be much, much longer and still be appropriate. I will edit my review as I play through the game more if I feel there is something worth mentioning that I come across. However, I feel that this is a pretty good summary that hopefully gives you a good picture of the game. Seriously, go get it, like, right now. You won\\'t regret it.Final Update, 11/27/11:Ok, after playing the game for roughly 50 hours I have finally beaten Skyward Sword. In short, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Each and every hour spent in this game was filled to the brim with brilliance and excellence, and not one single minute felt like boring filler that artificially extended the game. This feels like the Super Mario Galaxy 2 of Zelda titles, where there seems to be an exciting new gameplay/puzzle element at every turn. The story is incredible, with a lot of twists that genuinely thrilled and surprised me. This game essentially acts as an origin story for the entire Zelda series. Pretty much every element that you\\'re familiar with from Zelda games see their true origin here, and it is spectacular (I won\\'t give any spoilers though, you\\'ll be blown away when you experience it for yourself). I have to say that I have not been this entranced and enthralled by a Zelda game since Ocarina of Time or The Wind Waker, and I am a HUGE fan of pretty much every entry in the entire Zelda series, so I don\\'t say that lightly. The music is among the series\\' very best, which by itself is a massive accomplishment. The visuals the art design are incredibly beautiful, some of the most gorgeous and brilliantly inspired of the past decade, despite the underpowered system it is on. Because of all of this, I was compelled to play this constantly until beating it, AND there\\'s a new game plus mode that adds substantially to the game as well! For fans of the series, this game is an immediate must-own. I give it the highest recommendation possible. I absolutely love this game, and I\\'m fairly certain most of you out there will too.*That\\'s my final statement. This is meant to finalize the points I made from my original review, which I think will be as detailed and informative as anyone would want or need. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

       "   'reviewText': 'let me start by saying that the motion controls are beautiful! i realize that some people don\\'t appreciate this, but I believe that the motion controls add to the Zelda experience. the motion controls can be confusing if you do not read the directions, but other than that, it is wonderful. I don\\'t see why people can\\'t sit down and play this, I just pull up a chair about 7 feet from the TV and play from there if my legs get tired, it is not hard at all to play sitting down. if you stand too close to the TV though, it can be hard for the wii to read your motions, so you should stand/sit 6 to 10 feet from the TV. I am not going to say that if you don\\'t have this space you should not own a wii, because I know that there are some great games for it, including this one, and not everybody can have the space. so, I personally, think that motion controls made the game better, if not, the best.The golden remote is beautiful. It connects to the wii perfectly and its motion sensory is very precise. it weighs a little bit more than the non-motion plus controllers, but you don\\'t really notice unless you are comparing them directly and it does not affect the play. the bundle does not come with a nun-chuck, but it looks fine with an ordinary white or black one. all the buttons(including the B button)are white, except for the A and the D-pad(the button that looks like a big +) the A button is transparent and gold inside and the d-pad is a solid gold color. and of course none of it is real gold. the white triforce symbol is on top of the holes  that the sound comes out of on the front of the remote and is about the size of an SD card. it comes with a white rubber jacket and a white wrist strap. the remote has a built-in motion plus system and has good sound quality(for a wii remote)The music track includes 8 orchestrated songs from some of the past Zelda games, the songs are:1.\"the legend of Zelda 25th anniversary medley\" 8 Minutes2.\"Kakariko Village - Twilight Princess Theme\"  3 Minutes3.\"The Wind Waker Symphonic Moment\"  10.5 Minutes4.\"Gerudo Valley\"  3.5 Minutes5.\"Great Fairy\\'s Fountain Theme\"  3 Minutes6.\"Twilight Princess Symphonic Moment\"  10.5 Minutes7.\"The Legend of Zelda Main Theme\"  4.5 Minutes8.\"Ballad of the Goddess from Skyward sword\"  2 Minutesall of the songs are beautiful and well done. they really make you think back to how great it was playing the older games and at the same time make you exited for the new game.Now, the actual game, Skyward sword, is beautifully done. the watercolor art is one of a kind in the videogameing world today. at first the artwork looks kind of weird, after all we see now a days is realistic lifelike graphics, but Skyward sword is a break from all that, a kind of cartoonish style to appreciate. because of this, people say that the graphics are \\'bad\\' or that they look weird, but after a while you get used to it and it is a good a game as any \\'Call of Duty\\' or \"Elder Scrolls\" games, if not, better. the fully orchestrated music makes it all the better, it is truly a whole new way of playing Zelda. The plot is deep and New, very exiting! I am so thankful I preordered the game and remote when I did, because this was really limited edition.the gameplay is easy at first, but it does get harder to beat enemies as you get further. don\\'t let this discourage you though, just as in all the other Zelda games, the common enemies are easy to beat as you go along. you can figure out ways to beat them and bosses if you pay attention. the game is so fun! I have gotten pretty far in the game, but i have not finished yet. so far I have not had to use a guide or go online for hints, and I\\'m only 15. so, have fun, good luck, I hope I could help, and i hope you greatly consider buying this game.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The Wind Waker is a very interesting game, to say the least. When in development, never had another Zelda game garnered such polarized reactions from anticipating fans with regards to their reaction to WW\\'s artistic style. Once gamers got their hands on this gem, however, all fears of Zelda going astray and becoming childish were quickly dispelled and we were treated to one special game. You know, one could argue that The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the greatest Zelda game of all time. You could also argue that Twilight Princess is the best, most refined Zelda game of all time. I actually agree with both of these statements. Despite that, though, Wind Waker is still my personal favorite Zelda game, and one that I have an absolutely incredible amount of nostalgia for. It truly is a special game.The most noticeable and immediately striking aspect of Wind Waker is undoubtedly its graphics. Despite initial cynicism, most people came to embrace this aspect of the game and view it as one of its strongest aspects. The cel shaded graphics on display here are spectacularly vibrant, and seem to really pop off the screen as if you were actually looking through a window into a 3D space. Another great benefit of this graphical style is that it really lends itself to emotional, impactful storytelling. In fact, I find that Wind Waker\\'s characters convey emotion and thoughts better than 95% of games released now, despite how many are using advanced technology like motion capture these days. This really adds to the impact and emotional strength of Wind Waker\\'s already moving, epic story.The art design really compliments this cel shaded graphical style well. The places you go, the people you encounter, all of it screams classic, nostalgic Zelda while taking you to places of, well, not EXACTLY Hyrule, but sort of, that you won\\'t expect. From going into flaming volcanoes to inside an island held entirely in a magical, vast hallowed-out tree trunk, this is one heck of a visual adventure. Sailing across a vast ocean never looked so good. The music cannot go unmentioned either. You will hear classic Legend of Zelda themes and motifs in the music, but also new music that really fits in with that classical Zelda vibe, while striking a decidedly more colorful tone on its own. The sound design is of equal caliber as well and really add to the atmosphere of every environment you visit.Seeing how this IS a Zelda game, you can pretty much guess the premise of the story. It\\'s set in a world where the ocean covers most of the landscape, pock-marked by islands big and small. On one particular island, it is customary for boys of a certain age to dress as the legendary Hero of Time from the now-fairy-tale folklore people tell(the same story that gamers played in Ocarina of Time), in order to instill and emulate in the boy the same courage as that legendary Hero of Time. Well, it\\'s one boy\\'s birthday, but his wearing the Hero\\'s tunic is more than customary, as he is about to become his own fabled hero. His sister is kidnapped by a giant, evil bird, and he goes out to save her.That\\'s the initial premise of the story. It\\'s not entirely derivative of the princess in distress tale we\\'re used to, and by the end of this epic tale, Link will have joined pirates, become the next Hero approved by the Gods, go through dungeons for ancient, powerful artifacts to save the day, meet familiar characters, and have one heckuva climatic ending sequence. To think, that\\'s just a taste of where the story will take you. I have to admit, when I first went into WW, I expected amazing gameplay, gorgeous sound and art design, and a merely decent, acceptable story, but boy was I in for a surprise! The story here is exceptionally deep, even surprisingly dark at times, and that is right up my alley. I absolutely love the story in Wind Waker, and it may very well be my favorite aspect. It definitely isn\\'t \"kiddy\" in any sense of the word. It\\'s as adult as any of Link\\'s adventures have ever been. I really don\\'t want to give away any specific details, but suffice to say I picked my jaw off the floor, and even held back a tear here and there, more than once throughout the entire tale. It\\'s truly special.The gameplay is as you would expect from a Zelda game, meaning refined, near perfection. The basic format is here. Explore a large open world, find important areas and meet important people, go on side-quests, enter crucial temples, go through dungeons with its various clever puzzles and new gadgets imperative to succeed, and fight epic boss battles. The only thing different here is that instead of traversing dry land on epona, you traverse vast oceanic spaces on The Red King of Lions. Because the overworld is an ocean, this really does feel like the biggest Zelda game space ever, even in retrospect.Some find the sailing parts to be boring, but not me. I find them very relaxing, and enjoyable to take in the game world. Radiant sunrises, beautiful sunsets, and storms on the open seas is a sight to behold, and its scenes like this during the sailing sequences that really add to the atmotsphere of the story. There are less Temples in Wind Waker than other Zelda games, and is a bit shorter as a result. It also seems to be a bit easier than other titles in this franchise, but none of these \"issues\" lessen the value of the experience in any way. This is as good as Zelda gameplay gets. In fact, there is a substantial amount of swordplay improvement here over its predecessors, and that really adds to the feeling of being a legendary swordsman hero. Amazing stuff.I know that I\\'m missing some of the more minor details here, but I\\'m sure you get the idea. I could write twice this much, times three, about this amazing gemstone in Nintedo\\'s gaming library. As a matter of fact, I have played this game at least once each year since I bought it (2005), and it never gets old or shows any signs of age whatsoever. It\\'s a timeless classic and a must-play for anyone who loves Zelda adventures with fantastic stories. This game feels like a prettier, more stylistic Ocarina of Time. It has an incredibly epic story, a beautiful imagination-fueled design, and gameplay bordering on perfection. It really is that good. Buy it, sail through its majesty, and become a new hero worthy of legend!',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Hi,So today I\\'d like to share my thoughts on the Wii system. My girlfriend and I made the purchase a couple of years ago as an alternative to going out to celebrate the New Year. Right off the bat we had fun just trying to track down and buy the product, as this was still around the holiday period where everyone just had to have it, lol. We actually grabbed the last one in Wal-Mart and have enjoyed it intermittently ever since. The majority of the payment for the device was done via gift cards we had obtained, so I did not feel as hesitant to drop money on a console which I knew was not going to be able to offer me the games I typically play. Today, I would not hesitate to recommend the system at all, as a $150.00 price point is awfully appealing for the amount of fun it can bring to your living room.What I have found though, is that the Wii system is not necessarily meant to be used by just one person at a time. It is definitely more fun with two or more people and the early Nintendo commercials with the tagline \"Wii can play together\" really hit the nail on the head, so to speak. Currently, my girlfriend and I enjoy playingLEGO BATMAN (WII),Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Wii Play with Wii Remote,Wii Sports, andMario Kart Wii with Wii Wheel.We considered the Wii Play and Mario Kart games as value purchases as not only did they allow us to grab games we could play together, they also came with a secondary controller as well as a Wii wheel. Of course, the Wii Wheel is not a necessity but it does enhance the overall experience a bit.At times however, I have found myself looking to explore the single player games that the Wii has to offer and have just purchasedThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Nintendo Selects). Once I have a few hours under my belt I will be posting a review. In the meantime, we have continued to explore the Wii Shop Channel, giving you access to vintage games found on the SNES, N64, and beyond. We have also used the built-in Opera Web Browser, headline news feature, and weather forecaster. All simple to use but help to enhance the value of the console.For those who might have an old Gamecube lying around, don\\'t throw it out! All those games are backwards compatible on most systems, and it is nice to see that the Wii has wi-fi built in, a feature that the original Xbox 360 failed to include.For now I would like to conclude by saying that the Wii offers fun for those who are with a friend, enough extra features like Netflix and a built in web browser to keep it competitive amongst your other entertainment devices, and lower priced games that make purchasing a little more guilt free.If you are looking for a good way to hang out with the kids or a way to create some laughs on those rainy days at the beach house/ hotel room the Wii deserves your consideration. Please feel free to leave a comment with any additional questions or if you need assistance in making accessory or gaming recommendations.Thanks,Sean',\n",

Origianlly, I didn't want to buy a Wii, nor the new Zelda game, due to the two reasons:1.) At first glimpse, I didn't see how the Wii controllers would go well. Compared to the standard, classic controllers where you hold it with two hands at close range rather than apart just made me doubt the Wii's success.2.) I've played majority of all Zelda titles and so far after Ocarina of Time(1998) almost every Zelda game was a disappointment to me. Majora's Mask: SUCKED! (sorry for those who loved it, but I didn't like it at all, especially a *direct sequel* to Ocarina of Time. Come On!). The Gameboy Color Zelda games (Oracle of Ages & Seasons). Didn't understand them, since each game you play on the Gamboy is the *exact* same level designs. That was annoying. Finally, when Zelda: The Wind Waker came out I admit I was impressed with the level design and gameplay, but the problem was the graphics and art direction. Look just like a chibi anime. WTF! Wind Waker was probably the only Zelda that I didn't even like Link. Link, the hero and protagonist of the game. Even Ganondorf! He looked old and fat when he should be strong. How can the game designers screw that up. Seriously! In 2008 when I saw the trailer to Twilight Princess that was when I gave up. I almost lost faith to the Zelda franchise and it made me worry it's gonna go down with the Final Fantasy franchise.Three years later...AUG 2011 - I bought a Nintendo Wii not because of the only few good Wii games, but because you have the opportunity to download the old Classic Nintendo titles. That was when I decided I gave Twilight Princess one more chance to redeem the past console titles. It did.I literally got addicted playing this. This has got to be one the Zelda games that had the best graphics, gameplay, epic boss fights/battles, and even story. Since I don't officially have a top 5 list of Best Zelda games, I have three that I would most sincerely consider the best Zelda games so far.1.) LoZ: Ocarina of Time2.) LoZ: Twilight Princess3.) LoZ: A Link to the PastMore to come.In conclusion, this game is what most Zelda fans dream it would be. It's dark. It's nostalgic. The gameplay beats all Zelda games by far (my most favorite part of the game is when you're riding your horse in battle in the Hyrule Field using your sword to fight against your enemies riding giant boars). Finally, the story was like a fresh new start to the next generation of The Legend of Zelda. I really hope Nintedo can finally understand what some fans want the next Zelda games to be. Because of Peter Jackson's successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, so many fantasy film makers and video game designers were inspired by the films. I hope maybe in the future Zelda will become epic and nostalgic with gameplay and story.\",\n",

It's so much easier and faster to aim the bow/longshot/slingshot and shoot the targets/enemies rather than have to fool around with the control stick. The 3d graphics are beautiful. It really looks as if you are walking through 3d space. The landscape seems to be full of life, and the colors are so brilliant it seems so real.

       "   'reviewText': 'In the field of motion pictures, a generally accepted norm for \"greatest film ever made\" seems to be Orson Welles\\' classic\"Citizen Kane.\" Because games are a relatively young medium compared to cinema, it was only until about 14 years ago thata contender for \"greatest game ever made\" stepped forth. To this day, many consider it to be the birthing place of 3D conventionsthat are still used quite frequently. That game is \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\", and on the 25\\'th anniversary of theZelda franchise, Nintendo has given it a facelift on it\\'s newest handheld, the 3DS. Diehard fans of the original (raises hand)and newcomers alike are about to astounded by the results.For the virgins in the audience, \"Ocarina of Time\" follows Link, a young boy who lives in the Kokiri Forest, a place where children frolic about with fairy companions. But a peaceful game this is not, for the patriarch of the forest, The Great Deku Tree, summons the boy before him and reveals that he has a much bigger life ahead of him than previously expected. Before he passes on, the tree sends Link on a quest that will span vast distances, and transcend the very fabric of time itself. This quest will determine the future of Hyrule, for if the young warrior fails, the land which is home to thousands will be plunged into an eternity of nightmares by Ganondorf, known by many as the King of Evil.With this plot, the stage is set for a journey of epic proportions. Back in the Nintendo 64 era, a game of this scope was unheard of, and revolutionized what we expected from interactive entertainment forever. But does it hold up by today\\'s harsh standards? With what Nintendo has done, it not only holds up, but still exceeds a good 90% of what we see on the market in 2011. For a game made over a decade ago, that\\'s no easy feat.Of course, to do this, the developers had to perform cosmetic surgery on the whole experience. The first, most noticeable change is the fact that the graphics have been rebuilt entirely. Gone are the blocky sprites we saw so many years ago; every character, even the vast multitude of NPCs, are positively teeming with life, moving with fluid gestures we never thought capable from the game. That attention has also been given to the many locales the player will be visiting, with every town, dungeon and field popping off of the screen. These are the most impressive graphics out there on the 3DS right now, and without a doubt the most novel use of it\\'s 3D capabilities. When plugged into a wall, playing with the 3D turned on is highly recommended, for it will provide an experience that simply must be seen to be appreciated.But a simple graphical overhaul just wouldn\\'t be enough for a game with admittedly antiquated mechanics, which is why \"OoT 3D\" makes brilliant use of the system\\'s dual screens. The new gameplay eliminates having to shift through four different menus on one pause screen, allocating all item and equipment management to the bottom touch screen. The abilities to equip four items at once, to shuffle through equipment at a breakneck pace, and no longer having to equip the Ocarina are all welcome changes to the game. Also welcome is the gyroscope in the 3DS, meaning that you can now aim items such as the hookshot and bow with your own hands. This kind of interactivity beats even the Wii Remote aiming present in \"Twilight Princess\", and after engaging in it, you\\'ll find it hard going back to the old method.Some things shouldn\\'t be touched when modifying the classics, though; just look at what Spielberg did to \"E.T.\" One of the most beloved things about \"OoT\" is Koji Kondo\\'s chill-inducing soundtrack, and diehards will pleased to know that it remains entirely intact in this remake. While it would\\'ve been nice to see some kind of orchestral rearrangement of the score, the nostalgia nerd in all of us will feel right at home with these tunes.Extras, like the Master Quest and boss gauntlet, are really just icing on the cake. This is a killer version of a killer game, and perhaps now the strongest reason to own a 3DS. This writer cannot emphasize enough on how absolutely phenomenal this game is, and in the end, it\\'s up to you to take the first step on your journey to save Hyrule, whether it\\'s your first or five-hundreth.Do you have what it takes?Plot: A+Gameplay: A+Graphics: A+Music: A+Overall: A+ (Superb)',\n",

It\\'s known for it\\'s astounding gameplay (that\\'s a fancy way of saying how fun it is) and instantly recognizable esthetics (style).For Twilight Princess, they chose a darker/ more realistic style (compared to other titles in the series, which are famous for their color). You play as Link, a young man trying to save his home country from a great darkness that has spread over the land. Along the way, you\\'ll explore dungeons and gain the ability to transform into a wolf. As well as gaining new weapons like a boomerang, bow & arrow, bombs, and all sorts of other things.This game can only be played with the Wiimote & Nunchuck controls (which come with the Wii). The Wiimote controls Link\\'s sword, but you\\'ll also use it to point-and-shoot with your bow & arrow or boomerang. What makes Twilight Princess distinct is how very BIG it is. The land of Hyrule (where Link lives) is huge, so huge you\\'ll have to ride around one horseback to travel around. Plus, it\\'s home to the most interesting dungeons in the series, and the biggest \"bosses\" Zelda has ever known.Now, my only complain is that using the Wiimote to control Link\\'s sword never felt it was precise enough compared to the old way (using a button). But, that\\'s not enough to break the game. This was one of the first games on the Wii, so they hadn\\'t perfected the technology yet. Plus, the Wiimote does make pointing & shooting a lot easier. And TP is just so great. There\\'s an expansive dessert, wonderfully detailed bridges, a beautiful waterfall, and much, much more.So, pick it up as soon as you can.

       "   'reviewText': \"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was released on the Wii in 2007, about a year after the Wii console itself came out. This was a highly anticipated game because it was the last entry in the trilogy of the excellent Metroid Prime games, which started out on the Gamecube. And it delivers big time and shows that the Wii can foster great looking games with motion controls done in the right way. While The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess may have disappointed some gamers because it started out as a Gamecube title and only added motion controls for its debut launch on the Wii, MP3:C was developed from the ground up for the Wii.You once again take control of Samus as you explore new worlds and face old and new enemies. Like in the previous games, you fight your way to get a hold of new weapons to acquire and use against your enemies & get past areas that were previously not accessible. The visors also return and you use different them for different functions.So that part of the game hasn't changed much and anyone who has played the previous two games in the series will feel right at home. The major difference this time are the continuing story, the controls and the obvious benefits on being on a more powerful console.The PROS: Retro Studios made a huge name for themselves by showing they can take a popular Nintendo franchise and bring it to life as an adventure title disguised as a first person shooter with adventure elements. If there were any issues with Metroid Prime 1 and 2, this game eliminated them and balances everything out. The graphics are gorgeous, detailed and are top notch. The controls, including the gestures (they are kept to a minimum), are spot on and you can tweak the settings so it plays like one of your favorite FPSs. The music, sound effect and voice acting from the NPCs you encounter all fit right in and help immerse you into the planets you visit. You have a difficulty setting option so this game will challenge once you bump it up.The CONS: Well there isn't much to say here except that there is no online functionality with this game because it was released before Nintendo launched their Wi-Fi Connection service to play games online. Some people might be bummed that there is no multiplayer function but that's actually a good thing. There were multiplayer modes in Metroid Prime 2 but it did not play out so well and Metroid Prime Hunters,a multiplayer focused title, was released on the Nintendo DS to mixed fan reaction and reviews. Like I said before, some players may need to tweak the controls before playing the game to suit their way of playing. These are just minor gripes that don't derail the overall quality this game brings to the Wii.Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is an excellent game that should be in your collection and is a great way to end the Metroid Prime games. If you haven't picked this up yet, go get it. If you haven't played any of the Metroid Prime games, go get the Metroid Prime Trilogy instead. This collection has all 3 games with motion controls and optimized graphics added to the first two games. Either way, it is worth playing so don't miss out.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Forgive me Source-Code for I have sinned. For years I was a dedicated PC-gamer. I though ill of gaming consoles, considering them consumer-toys rather than entertainment systems. Who needs overpriced and oversized gaming consoles that can play Movie-DVDs and even BluRayDisks when most good games are released for PCs as well and they look and play better on them, right? Well, the NINTENDO Wii is a different breed.Gaming on the Wii is an experience one has to live at least once - but preferably whenever he or she feels blue. Sure, it may not sport the cutting-edge graphical capabilities of a SONY PS3 or the game titles selection of the XBox. Nevertheless, most Wii games take full advantage of the console's capabilities and the exclusive games selection include the unsurpassableThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the absorbingMetroid Prime Trilogy, the mesmerizingOkamiand the soothingEndless Ocean: Blue World.Not to mention the capabilities ofWii Fit PlusandWii Sports Resortwhen coupled with aWii Balance Board!This is a black edition - and it looks great. I keep mine in our TV room and the black blends perfectly with my other home entertainment electronics. In any case, do not miss the revolution.There is simply no other console that offers so much fun. Both SONY and MICROSOFT have technologically excellent gaming consoles - but NINTENDO is the only one that always keeps in mind that gaming is supposed to be FUN.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'I remember that Christmas, 22 years ago, my 2 kids (boy-8, girl-10) get done opening their presents, then me, Mom, turning the TV on and I start playing Super Mario Bros. on our new Nintendo game system!  You\\'ve never seen 2 happier kids in your life!LOL!  About a month later I picked up Zelda, the 1st & the beginning of what would become my collection of many Zelda games!  We would sit for hours on end helping each other explore Zelda\\'s world, and battle thru each dungeon!  Thankfully, Dad wasn\\'t into video games too much, so the three slots available for each new player worked out perfectly, as each of us had our own game slot to play!  What was nice is nobody fought over it, we each took turns playing and battling all those nastly little creatures that would kill us so many times and, unless we were in a dungeon....ya had to start over again! and again, and again, yes, me and my 2 kids were, & still are, very determined and headstrong! LOL  And talk about family dynamics, doing something together and working together, if we didn\\'t before we got Zelda, we sure did after we got it! LOL We\\'d sit together, including Dad who didn\\'t play but sure had ALOT of input after watching us for so long, and help each other, giving directions AND, thanks to a friend giving us a Nintendo Power Magazine that had the overworld map with all the Heart Container locations, where to bomb, what bushes to burn...etc, totaly working together in order to beat the game!  Absolutely an awesome, extremely addicting game!So here we are, over 20 years later, STILL playing that game! What does that tell you about....#1. the games re-play value? & #2. the total worth of the game?  In my opinion, this game is a deffinate keeper and if you DON\\'T have it.....GET IT!  I not only own this version of Zelda for my NES, I also own it for my Nintendo DS handheld game system with the GBA port! And YES, I still play it! LOL  I just purchased thru Amazon, the Collector Disc for the GameCube so that I can NOW enjoy Zelda & Zelda II (My #1 favorite of these 2 Zelda games) on my Wii!  YES!!  My husband, the non-video gamer, did end up becoming addicted to Zelda II: The Adventures of Link,which I purchased way back then for the Nintendo, not too long after getting addicted to this first one! So since we are \"new\" to the Wii, which he\\'s not played yet, I can\\'t wait until my Zelda Collector Disc arrives>>>>which SHOULD be today!! :)  I will be playing Zelda all over again on my Wii!  I truly beleive the game is that good!  Also, there\\'s an \"underworld\" you can play after beating the game, it\\'s the same as the \"overworld\" only they moved things around on ya and you have to type LINK into the game slot, now THAT\\'S some re-play for ya! LOLBesides Zelda I & II for the Nes and GBA, I also have Four Swords for the SNES & GBA, Minnish Cap-GBA, 2 LOZ\\'s for my DS(which I also rate 5 star & are top of my list with LOZ I & II), 2 gamecube LOZ\\'s for my Wii, Twilight Princess for the Wii AND a deposit down on LOZ\\'s Skyward Sword coming out later this year for the Wii! Hmmm.....Think I\\'ma Zelda fan?  nah!! LOL!!This game is worth it\\'s wait in GOLD, I don\\'t think, or see how, it could EVER lose it\\'s value OR it\\'s \"re-play\" value! It, to me, has the right amount of difficulty level, just like most games out there, it gets tuffer & tuffer as you progress!  I LOVE the graphics, in all honesty, better than some of the newer, modern, updated Zelda games! I really think the best looking Link was the \"up-graded\" version they came up with in Zelda II, and also the easiest Link to control and maneuver around! So I\\'m going to have to say the same thing for the controls! The 1st time I sat down and played the newer Zelda games on my Wii, I had a heck of a time getting Link to run in a straight line or do what I wanted him to do WHEN I wanted him to do it! LOL! The controls for this original Zelda game on the NES were right on, no problems at all. I really do wish some of these newer ones had that same type of control & look to them. (my only exception would be my DS & GBA Zelda games with which I have NO problems with either on the handheld!)  So there ya go, there\\'s my review & recommendation for The Legend Of Zelda I....and II: The Adventures Of Link!  Game On....Zelda Forver!',\n",

In fact, the PlayStation Eye is actually the exact same thing as Kinect except that it doesn't have a depth sensor and Sony hasn't released any voice recognition software for it publically, but it can do that. In fact, the resolution for the PlayStation Eye is actually of a much better quality. Ultimately, Kinect will end up being just like the wii because of these limitations, a shovelware party game magnet with only a miniscule amount of it's library being able to offer something even remotely innovative. With Kinect, it's all very convenient and user-friendly, but it feels awkward to perform actions like driving a car, or sword figthing without something to hold onto, and even then when you're using objects that can imitate such actions,m there is the matter of gesture confusion.

It just feels better to be using something like a Wii wheel, not to mention that it has a much faster response time and it's nowhere near as glitchy because of gesture confusion. That is why I don't like Kinect very much. There is just too much room for error, and those limitations will likely keep it from having any staying power within the hardcore gaming community.

It's what everyone wanted out of the Wii in the first place. It's even gotten better reviews than Kinect, beating both it and wii motion plus as best motion controller in gamescon 10 and popular science magazine. And you can't say that it's copying the Wii because development on it started at the exact same time as that motion device while they were developing the eye toy. The only reason they decided to release it now is because they were perfecting the tech and giving developers time with it. I own a Wii with the motion plus and move is far more accurate and responsive, and that in turn makes it far more accurate and responsive than Kinect as well).

The wii is fun, but mopst of the software isn;t ijn my tastes except for Monster Hunter Tri, Metroid Prime: Trilogy, and Super Mario Galaxies 1 & 2. So get the 320 gb move bundle.

Ultimately, the ideal thing would be to buy all gaming systems to experience all the fantastic software they have to offer, but if you can only go one way, I think you should pick the PS3.

       "   'reviewText': 'I\\'m not accustomed to the Legend of Zelda franchise and in fact Twilight Princess has been my first game from this franchise, but let me tell you I found this game to be an immense pleasure. Twilight Princess really makes you think and while it\\'s not to challenging, it\\'s not too easy either. There are many times when I was in a dungeon and really confused just saying \"huh\" and then when I found out the puzzle I would go \"duh!\" In fact Twilight Princess took me over sixty hours to complete...and I still haven\\'t gotten everything. This game is easily one of my favorite games ever, but why not I give you my reasons why I love it so much, and if you disagree... hey it\\'s my opinion.One high point to Twilight Princess was the story, I had never been so interested in a video game storyline, and I never got sick of the long cut scenes, in fact I eagerly awaited them to see what would happen next. Twilight Princess begins in Ordon Village as Link helps at the ranch herding goats, but when the village children are kidnapped by a group of monsters Link pursues the attackers and gets trapped in Midna\\'s (a member of the Twili) affairs in the Twilight.I especially liked the characters, but Link\\'s not my favorite, in fact Midna was. Midna is the kind of character that could have been really and I truly mean REALLY annoying, but she has this quality that makes you like her. And she really balances out the serious tone of Link, there are also many other characters that can provide a laugh or that you may help in a side mission. But a few missions I still haven\\'t finished, the Poe souls can be a really big hassle to collect because there are so many and some only come out at night, it takes way to long and gets tiresome. But some were pretty fun like fixing the bridge by Hyrule Castle.But the most important part of any video game is the gameplay, in Twilight Princess you get plenty of this. Hyrule Field is huge and it takes over six minutes to go across and that\\'s while riding Epona, and another plus is that the scenery changes, and seeing the sunset while you cross the bridge of Eldin is awesome. And the dungeons are numerous and all unique, there is an old damaged house covered with ice and snow, a dungeon scorched with lava in the Goron mines, and so on. But I was disappointed with Castle Town, there isn\\'t much to do or many people to talk to and it just feels so limited. But most of the time you are pretty much on your own and free to mess around. The reason I love playing this game is because you have to be very observant of your surroundings. Once when I was in Hyrule Field I noticed a ledge I could Claw Shot to, and there was a cave, inside the cave was a heart piece but I would have never found it if I wasn\\'t exploring. To me games without a set path are so much fun but it comes with some pretty hard challenges. I played the game without a guide and it can be pretty challenging, so if you\\'re planning on collecting all the bugs, Poe souls and every heart piece you definitely need a guide. I especially loved Riding Epona in Twilight Princess, first of all Hyrule Field would take forever to explore by foot, and riding Epona is so much fun, the controls are very fluid and that makes riding around a blast.Another huge aspect of gameplay is Link...transformed into wolf form. Playing as wolf Link is definitely not as fun as being human Link but I absolutely loved using the sense button, (pressing the sense button lets you see hidden objects underground and Poe\\'s and other objects) but I will admit, later in the game you have the option of transforming from human Link to wolf Link whenever you want, and I never chose to be wolf Link unless it was absolutely nessecary. But I\\'m not saying being wolf Link is boring, it can be pretty fun sometimes, and it\\'s in interesting part of the game\\'s gameplay.The graphics are fantastic in Twilight Princess, I love the detail put into Link\\'s clothing, the villages and the landscapes were all so much fun to see. And Epona has realistic movements as well, it\\'s also really awesome crossing the bridge of Eldin at sunset and looking at the sun set behind Hyrule Castle, elements like these make gameplay twice as fun. But sometimes I got a little sick of being in the Twilight, the backgrounds are all faded and murky and it kind of takes away from the landscapes that were impressively designed. But overall it\\'s fantastic, I also liked the detailed creatures, sometimes it can actually be freaky being chased by the huge boars in Hyrule Field because of the well detailed design. But like I said cross the bridge of Eldin and you\\'ll see what I mean.Twilight Princess also has some nice music here and there while I didn\\'t enjoy the music while in the Twilight realm. But a few particular tracks stood out to me, like Midna\\'s Lament, Gerudo Desert, of course the Hyrule Field Theme and one of my favorite locations is without any music. When you\\'re on the outside of Hyrule Castle all you hear is rain pouring down on the cement path and it really works. And while I agree with others it would have been great to hear Twilight Princess orchestrated the music still is fantastic compared to some other games I\\'ve played.Now there is a choice, which console should you get Twilight Princess on, the GameCube or the Wii? If you own the Wii you may want to get it on that since many say the graphics are slightly improved and targeting is much better, but most people looking at the GameCube version probably don\\'t have a Wii but I just wanted to say, the experience is still very satisfying either console you get Twilight Princess on. With that said I will conclude with this thought, this may be my first experience with the Zelda franchise but it definitely won\\'t be my last. Twilight Princess is highly recommended.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"The story of The Wind Waker takes place on a series of islands on the sea somewhere, a first for the series. It tells about Link and his struggle with Ganondorf for control of the Triforce. He spends a good portion of his time trying to find his little sister, who's kidnapped at the beginning of the game. He also spends a portion of his time sailing, traveling through dungeons and temples and the like on his quest to gain power to defeat Ganondorf yet again.Personally, I don't understand what all the hoopla was about. Back before this game came out, Zelda fans cried foul because the game went cel-shaded, claiming it was geared more towards kids. Once you boot this game up and begin to play, you'll find out this game is still pure Zelda. Besides, sometimes a series needs change to stay alive and fresh. I love it myself and I've been a loyal Legend of Zelda gamer for years. It ranks up there with my other favorites(like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask,The Minish Cap and Twilight Princess).Gameplay in the game goes largely unchanged from the scheme in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. There's tons of side-quests to do, besides what you do on the quest, that are (as always) alot of fun. My favorite being when Link obtains what they call the Deluxe Picto Box(camera) that he uses to take pictures of enemies and non-playable characters for a character named Carlov, who uses them to sculpt figurines(134, in all). I think the thing I like most about The Wind Waker is that Link can pick up and use certain enemy's weapons.The cool thing about The Wind Waker is that the story doesn't end here. It continues on in Legend of Zelda:Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS, which follows Link as he journeys to save his friend Tetra from Bellum(the story's antagonist) with the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck.I highly recommend Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker to one and all. It's an adventure that, like Ocarina of Time, shouldn't be missed.\",\n",

Now with Sony & Microsoft trying to copy what Nintendo has showcased to a wide variety of games to gamers everywhere, it is impossible to not give that recognition for the Wii. With many great games like Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Super Smash Brothers Brawl bringing new smiles to Wii gamers off all ages, Nintendo has shown that they can go beyond the standard controller. Now, with all the hype, Nintendo is finally releasing their very first bundle pack for the Wii, and it has been well-worth the wait, with a bit of extremes for the sports nut in all of us.The Nintendo Wii Sports Resort Bundle Pack, is a great price and a great deal of excitement for anyone who loves sports in each and every way. You get the Wii system with Nintendo's hits Wii Sports Resort, as well as the classic original Wii Sports which is also included with the Nintendo Wii. The gameplay with both games is very strong as you compete in favories like Golf, Baseball and tennis (Wii Sports,) and many other great games. Through Wii Sports Resort, you also get to compete in bike racing, the thrills of skydiving, shooting 3-point shots in basketball, scoring extreme strikes in 100 pin bowling, and go play fetch with your Wii pal puppy by tossing a frisbee, or many other great challeneges. You also get the Wii Motion Plus which is very useful in Wii Sports Resort, as well as many other great Wii titles, sold seperately like Red Steel 2.You also get the opportunity to download your favorite games online through the Wii's Virtual Console like Art Style: Cubillo, and Mega Man 9, as well as classic video games from Nintendo, Sega & Neo-Geo systems like Super Mario World, Sonic The Hedgehog, and Bomberman. If you have Nintendo Gamecube games, they also are compatable with the Wii, so you can play your Gamecube favroites with Nintendo's Gmaecube controller, and master those challenges in Mario Party 7, race you way to the finish line in Need For Speed: Most Wanted, and many other Gamecube classics.There is also a brand new great deal of joy that is new for Wii owners, you also can now stream and watch your favorite movies online via Netflix with a Netflix movie subscription. You can watch all your favorite films via online like Titanic, E.T., Iron Man with Robert Downey Jr. and many other great films for as little as a few dollars a month extra on top of that by going to netflix's new Wii service through your broadband service. It really shows that Nintendo has also made its way to compete with the ways that Sony & Microsoft have shown with the PS3 & Xbox 360.All in all, if you're looking for a great video game system at a affordable price, now would honestly be a great time to get the Nintendo Wii for you and your family to enjoy & the Wii Sports Resort bundle pack that comes in the standard white, or a exclusively designed sleak and daring black. Not just with great games now, but also with upcoming trasures like Metroid: The Other M and Super Mario Galaxy 2 that are also fun & full of excitement for all ages.

While it took me about a month to beat the original Legend Of Zelda game this one like Ocarina Of Time kept me busy for several months just to reach the final boss. A lot of the gameplay mechanics, level designs and boss fights set a standard that influenced other games that came after it such as Ocarina for N64 and Twilight Princess for the Gamecube/Wii.This game is long but easy enough for the average yet dedicated gamer as well being challenging and deep for  the pros such as the ones at Nintendo Power who love it.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"As far as revolutionary goes, this is one of those systems that's a revolution in the video game industry with its unique motion feature and cool design. I actually downloaded a Wii for my sims in The Sims 2 because it seemed so exciting. My Playstation 3 just seems so big and bulky compared to the small and sleek design of the Wii. It looks great with any furniture set and it doesn't waste that much room either. It's not even complicated to set up and if you think so, the instruction booklet explains everything you have to do to set up your Wii thoroughly. Now I'll start with explaining the features of the Wii:1)Motion-sensing adds a whole new experience for casual gamers and hardcore gamers alike. You can put your Wii remote in anything-a baseball bat, a golf club, a tennis racket, a steering wheel, a gun, you name it. And if you don't like the feel of moving the Wii remote every which way and you'd rather keep it classic, you can just get the Wii classic controller and a grip so you can play classic games like Super Mario Bros. easily.2) There's a whole new genre of gaming with the Wii with motion and other accessories. In Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10, you can swing the golf club as if you would in real golf. In Punch-Out, you can box by smacking the Wii remote into the air to put some serious blows into your opponent. In Jenga, you actually have to pull the blocks out by moving the Wii remote cautiously as to not knock the tower down. In MarioKart Wii, you steer your Wii remote onto a race track to go for first place. In House of the Dead 2 and 3 Return, aim your Wii remote at the TV and destroy zombies. In The Conduit, you can use Wii Speak to speak to other players during gameplay. There are a bunch of possibilities on the Wii.3) The fact that you can play Gamecube games on the Wii would want to make you sell your Gamecube for some good money and keep the games for entertainment on the Wii. The Gamecube games are played as they would be played on the Gamecube with no special differences. For people who didn't own the Gamecube previously, this is a good chance for you to go out and get some good titles that you missed like Luigi's Mansion, Mario Golf, Chibi-Robo, Zelda Four Swords Adventures, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, Zelda Wind Waker, Smash Bros. Melee, Double Dash, Paper Mario, Resident Evil 1 and 2, Pikmin, King of Fighters 98, Animal Crossing and many more. All you have to do is plug your Gamecube controllers into the Wii, put in a memory card, put in you Gamecube disc, and start playing!4) Next-generation Nintendo games can not be played on any other system. Play games like Animal Crossing City Folk, Metroid Other M, Harvest Moon Tree of Tranquility, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and many more.5) The Mii Channel allows you to make and customize people to represent you in games. Some games like Sonic and Mario at the Olympic Games and Mario Super Sluggers allow you to use the Mii's in actual gameplay. And in games like Smackdown vs Raw, the Mii's just represent you. There is no limit to how many you make.6) Wii Shop Channel allow you to get games like Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 64, Donkey Kong Country, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many other games for people that haven't owned Nintendo 64s, Super Nintendo Entertainment Systems, Nintendo Entertainment Systems, Sega Genesis's and even Sega Game Gears. You can get these games for a decent price without having to pay for shipping. You can also buy new channels like a channel where you can access the Internet at any time.7) Other channels like Forecast Channel and News Channel allow you to do other things. The Photo Channel allows you to view photos. The Check Mii Out Channel allows you to look at other peoples' Miis. The Forecast Channel allows you to see the forecast from all around the world, whether it be the five-day forecast or just the current temperature, you can even see what it's like in Antarctica and Tokyo. The News Channel allows you to see news from all around the world instead of having to tune in to news channels on your TV.8) The Home Brew Channel allows you to do many cheats in games. In Sonic and Mario at the Olympic Games, you can play as a Goomba, Jet the Hawk, Silver the Hedgehog, and other scrapped characters. All you need is Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and a manual on how to get the Home Brew Channel and you're all set.9) Wi-fi allows you to play your video games with people around the world easily.10) Wii Sports is a fun and enjoyable game for beginners with the Wii. You can play golf, boxing, bowling, baseball, and tennis. It's very entertaining.That's most of the Wii's features. You have to have the Wii-you wouldn't regret buying it.\",\n",

As an old school gamer who grew up playing Nintendo systems, the Wii was the first \"next gen\" console that I sought out and I have been very pleased with the gaming experience that it offers. It is not a system designed for the hardcore gamer, rather one that is meant to reach a wider demographic of people who may not have grown up playing games. Below is a summary of the good and bad aspects of the system and the games available; keep in mind that these are subjective to the gamer.Pros:1. Quality first-person titles and an improving library of third-person games. Many may dismiss the Wii on the basis of it being a \"kiddy\" or \"lifestyle\" system based on the lack of adult-oriented games, however few can argue that Nintendo really delivers with their franchises. \"Super Mario Galaxy\", \"Metroid Prime 3\", \"Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\" and \"Mario Kart Wii\" are all fantastic games that really do the franchises justice. As the system has aged, more quality third-party titles have emerged such as \"Mad World\", \"House of the Dead: Overkill\", \"No More Heroes\", \"Okami\", and \"Klonoa\".2. Innovative controls. When properly utilized in a game, the unique motion controls of the Wii Remote are a blast and they do bring a new level of depth to the gameplay. Sports games, puzzles and platformers all benefit from this and it makes the game more involving; rather than having to remember what 8 buttons perform what functions, it\\'s all about pressing a few buttons and waggling the remote.3. User-Friendly Interface. The Wii menu is perhaps the most streamlined and easy to use dashboard out of all the consoles. The Wii Shop is also easy to navigate in and out of, and shopping for games and add-ons is a snap.4. The Virtual Console. As was the case with the GBA and the DS, Nintendo is making a killing off of their old titles. The Virtual Console allows you to download classic games from the NES, SNES, Genesis, Neo Geo, and a host of other systems. The Classic Controller is require to play them, however this is a nice add on especially for older gamers who grew up in the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.5. Integrated wireless card. If you have wireless internet and your router is compatible with the Wii, this is your best bet for connecting the console to the internet.Cons:1. No Ethernet port. I am not sure how Nintendo screwed this up, however there is no Ethernet port in the back of the console; there are only 2 USB ports and you will need to purchase a LAN adapter separately. This is an annoyance if you don\\'t use wireless internet.2. Inferior graphics. If you are a gamer that needs to have the best graphics, then you will be better off with the PS3 or the Xbox 360. The Wii has good graphics however it is technically inferior to the competition. Sadly, this means that some of the cross-platform titles will be inferior on the Wii, but then again graphics are not everything.3. Gimmicky games. Because of the unique controls, a lot of the games being produced for the Wii are gimmicky and focused more on the controls rather than story and gameplay. For me, this includes the \"Wii Fit\" and \"Wii Sports\". Both games were fun for the first few weeks, however I got bored once the novelty wore off and I have not played either game since. This has improved over the lifespan of the system, however this is still a lot of \"Shovelware\" being produced.4. Limited memory. The Wii only comes with 512 MB of internal memory, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the 120 GB and 160 GB hard drives being offered on the Xbox 360 and PS3 respectively. I guess this is because the Wii is not download-intensive, however the 512 MB gets eaten up quickly if you download a lot of Virtual Console and Wii Ware games. Fortunately, they system allows you to use an SD card to store and back-up downloaded content.The Pros and Cons of any video game system often depend on the gamer, so the above is just my own personal impressions after having owned my Wii for almost one year. Overall, I like the system a lot and I play it often despite a few shortcomings. I also own an Xbox 360 and that fulfills whatever needs that the Wii is not currently meeting, so I have no regrets about purchasing this console.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Positive:+ fun, reliable touch control scheme+ great graphics+ lots of stuff to collect+ makes use of (literally) every DS function imaginable+ dungeons are pretty fun+ boss battles make clever use of both screens+ writing on the map is a great feature+ multiplayer and online features are niceNegative:- the adventure is short and pretty easy- going through The Temple of the Ocean King several times throughout the game can be pretty repetitiveThe Legend of Zelda is a series famous for its consistency in great games, whether it be the revolutionary Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64 or the Wii launch title Twilight Princess. Zelda's 3-D games aren't the only ones that have been praised, however: fans still rave about SNES classic A Link to the Past and 2005's Minish Cap on the GBA was also well-liked. Now, the series takes a natural move onto the DS. Phantom Hourglass is a real winner in the series and on the system, making use of every DS function imaginable and delivering that same old Zelda experience we've all come to love.Phantom Hourglass is a follow up to The Wind Waker, and the story takes place pretty soon after its predecessor. Link, Tetra/Zelda, and the pirate crew are on an adventure to find new lands when they encounter the ghost ship, and Tetra is taken aboard. Link tries to jump onto the ship to save her, but falls into the water and wakes up on Mercay Island, where he meets a fairy, Ciela. Link soon finds out what he must do to save his friend and later becomes involved in an even more important adventure to stop the evil monster Bellum. The story is pretty good, and many memorable characters such as Linebeck make the dialogue interesting.Phantom Hourglass is played in the style of the 2-D Zelda games with a bird's eye view, but everything is in 3-D. Essentially, it's a new definition of 2.5-D. You move Link by directing him with the stylus, which works very well and is almost as reliable as a regular control stick or D-pad. You attack by touching an enemy or swiping the touch screen, and you roll by drawing circles on the edge of the screen. All the action is there on the bottom screen, but the map on the top screen is incredibly handy and useful, and you can even write notes on it! There are also a handful of nifty button shortcuts that make equipping items and bringing down the map all the quicker, and they're nice to use when you figure them out.The regular Zelda gameplay is evident in the game as you go through a dungeon and find your way to the next, but the game's huge world is traversed on a boat, and that's where Linebeck comes in. Although your reluctant helper can prove annoying on the journey for the hero, he provides transportation, which is essential to getting anything done. When you set sail, you draw your route on the touch screen and the boat proceeds to move along your set path. As you go along, you can shoot bombs with your cannon or salvage for treasure.Of course, the bulk of Phantom Hourglass is, like in all other Zelda games, the dungeons. This time around, the dungeons are really fun but almost disappointing at the same time. Of course, going through a dungeon has always been great fun, but in Phantom Hourglass, most of the dungeons present little to no challenge. They're generally really easy. I hardly broke a sweat getting through the first five dungeons or the game and I normally am in need of a guide right off the bat in a Zelda game. While the lack of challenge is a bit disappointing, the puzzles are still great and extremely clever. Of course, you also have your arsenal of items to help you, and the touch screen is put to good use when you're using these items, like drawing a path for your boomberang or bombchu and aiming your bow or grappling hook.The biggest challenge the game presents is in one dungeon you constantly revisit throughout your adventure: The Temple of the Ocean King. After almost every sub dungeon, you go through a little more of this one big dungeon to get a sea chart leading you to the next area of the sea or getting some information that'll help you get to the next place you need to go to. The main concept of this dungeon is the Phantom Hourglass, the game's namesake. While in the Temple, your hearts will be constantly drained when outside of safe zones, but only if your hourglass is out of time. As long as the hourglass has some sand of hours left in it, your life won't be sucked out of you. The sand can be charged up by going outside the Temple.The dungeon is also home to Link's most formidable enemies: the phantoms. They roam the corridors of the Temple and chase Link when they see him. If they hit you, you'll lost a minute's worth of sand and start back at the beginning of the floor. Unfortunately, you will have to go through the same floors several time before the game is over, and you'll get pretty tired of doing them over and over. This is the game's biggest issue, and there isn't anything else that really hurts the game aside from the mild difficulty.Phantom Hourglass displays some very nice DS graphics. They're viewed from above, but they're 100% 3-D. While you play they look very nice, but when you go up close in the main story parts, they don't look quite as good. Still, the cel-shaded graphical style is a winner yet again. The sound is also great with nice effects and good music.Thre is also a nice multiplayer feature available. You can use local wireless or Wi-Fi. One player plays as Link, and the other commands three phantoms. The Link player moves around the dungeon floor bringing force gems back to his area while the phantom player draws paths for the phantoms with a map and tries to catch Link. It's pretty fun to do, and it involves quite a lot of strategy to succeed. There is also a ranking system for this as well as achievements.Aside from the main adventure, there's quite a lot to do. There are the gems to collect that power you up, there are heart pieces, bomb bags, arrow quivers, treasures, sea charts, and... well, more. If you want to get all the stuff, you'll take quite a long time to do it, but have fun as you go just because of how enjoyable the game already is.To sum it all up, Phantom Hourglass is an excellent game. It provides a great Zelda experience, albeit an easy one, and shows us even more of what the DS is capable of. It's easily one of the top games for the system and is worth a spot in any Zelda fan's collection.Gameplay: 9.0Graphics: 9.0Sound: 9.0Value: 9.0FINAL SCORE: 9.2/10\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'As stated over 1,000 times before mii, the Wii is a great system for hardcore gamers, those who\\'ve been playing games for a long time, or casual gamers, those who are either new to videogames or play \"everybody can play\" games. While Wii may not offer state of the art HD visuals, it more than makes up for that with its intuitive gameplay and artistic graphics. In Wii Sports, if you want to hit a baseball with a bat, you swing the Wiimote just as you\\'d  a real bat, etc... the list goes on. With casual games like Wii Fit, Wii Music, and Wii Sports, those who consider themselves casual will not be disappointed. Contrary to popular belief, between games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Smash Bros: Brawl, and Guitar Hero: World Tour, Metroid Prime 3, Call of Duty: World at War, Mario Galaxy and countless VC and WiiWare titles such as Mega Man 9, Wii isn\\'t lacking in hardcore titles, either.So in short, if you\\'e been a fan of videogames all your life or are new to the scene, the Wii will NOT disapoint. Act quick, because the Wii happens to be quite a difficult item to reach these days.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The legend of Zelda has always been a series that continually delivers amazing games that are at the top of their class.  The legend of Zelda has always been my favorite video game series of all time since I was little and their games continually suck away hours of my life.  This is the game that made me truly love gaming(Before I just did it for fun).  It also set the stage for other great games such as majoras mask, wind waker, and twilight princess.Gameplay:  If you have played any of the other Zelda games, you will know that you play as Link, a young Kokiry boy who must go out on the adventure of a lifetime to defeat the evil Ganondorf and save Princess Zelda.  The controls are flawless.  You just move the analog stick to make Link move, move forward and press A to roll, press B to use your sword, the C buttons are home to you other weapons such as the bow, hookshot, and the like.  This game introduced the revolutionary lock on system where you just pressed Z, and staid locked on to an enemy, which meant no more aimless sword swinging, it realy made the combat more managable, and much more fun,  Like any Zelda game there is a huge overworld to explore.  You have grassy plains, tall volcanic mountains, serene lakes, sandy deserts, difeerent towns and villages, and lots to do.  The overworld is just enourmes, esspecially for an N64 game.  Hyrule feild stretches in all directions.  One of the great things about traveling is part way through the game, you will get a trusty horse named Epona.  Riding around hyrule feild is just realy addicting.  There are many great minigames to do as well, such as the shooting gallery, bombochu bowling, selling mask, and fishing, yes fishing.  There are also special task to do such as collecting ten special poes(Huge ghost that appear in hyrule feild), or collecting 100 Skulltullas(Spiders of a horrible curse).  The meat and Potatoes is of course the dungeons.  Each dungeon is completley uniqe and different than the last one and shows off alot of great elements.  There are many challenging puzzles that reward you when you figure them out.  You raise and lower water, look for paths that are invisible with the lens of trooth, push giant blocks with the silver gauntlets, use the megaton hammer to push blocks, and much much more.  Each dungeon is just very well crafted that it is hard to beleive that it came out in 1998.  There are many feirce enemies in each dungeon that fight to put an end to your quest such as Stalfos, bats, lizolfos, armos, iron knuckles, jellyfish, tektikes, readeds, skulltullas, and so many more.  The boss battles are each intricitley desighned and completely different than thre last in the way they look and fight.  The boss battle with Ganon at the end is one of my all time favorite final battles ever(only rivald by the fight in twilight princess, and Mother brain).  The difficulty is always just right with the challenges and enemys getting toupher as you go on.  Through the game you get alot of fantastic weapons to use, such as a bow, hookshot, megaton hammer, hovor boots, silver gauntlets, boomerangs, and much more.  Each is always put to good use and none of them ever go absolete and are awlays usefull the whole way through  One of the big mechanics is of course the ocarina itself, you play it manually with the button layout being like the holes in the real thing.  You can change day into night, transport across the world map, and open passage ways with you trusty instrument, and much more.  The biggest suprise is after you get the Master sword and travel forard in time seven years.  Time travel is a huge element in this game as some things you do as a child will effect the things you do as an adult, and vice versa.  there are also different things avalible to do in each time and it is a blast to go between two time periods and it realy makes you feel powerfull.  Nore matter which aspect of the gameplay I am talking about, I cannot find fault anywhere, absolutely perfect.Story:  Hyrule was created by din Nyrule, and Farore, they left behinf the triforce which lies in the Sacerd realm.  Many years later, an Evil Man named Ganondorf seeks the triforce and Places a curse on the deku tree, and does other horible things to many races .  The deku tree tells navi, the fairy that she must awaken Link as he has been having a nightmare about the evil man.  Link goes to get a sword and Sheild, and goes to see the great Deku tree who asks him to rid the curse.  Link succeeds but finds out that he is far to late.  Before dying, the Deku tree tells him the legond of the triforce and gives him the spirituall stone of the forest, the Kokirys emerald, and then tells him to go to hyrule castle to meet nPrincess Zelda.  Link goes to hyrule castle, meets princess Zelda Who tells him of the dreams she has been having about Ganondorf and Ask Link to get the other two stones, Link obliges and gets them but finds that it is to late As princess Zelda and Impa flee hyrule catsle, Zelda throws him the Ocarina of time.  Link then comes face to face with Ganondorf and gets a taste of his power.  Zelda then Telapethacally teaches him the song of time.  Link goes to the Temple of Time and Plays it at the alter where the stones are placed and opens the secret chamber where he finds the Master Sword.  Link being the legendary hero, takes the master sword, but finds that he has fallen into Ganondorfs trap.  He is then seald in time for seven years where he is awakened by the sage of light Rareu.  Link discovers that he is now an Adult.  and instructs him to find and awaken the other sages.  This is where the game gets epic, but I wont spoil anymore fore, suffice it to say it is a great story that is very well told and will keep you wanting to find out what happens next.Graphics:  These graphics were truly groundbraking and ahead of their time back in 1998.  The moment you step out into hyrule feild and se the scale and distance you will be mesmerized.  The game shows off some fantastic day and night sequences as well as many different colors.  Hyrule market looks and feels alive, the kakariko village will look like a town with houses and shops.  The desert esspecially is arguablly the best way to show off the N64s power with snadstorms and wind effects.  The Charecter models are great for Lnik, to Zelda, To Ganondorf, to the bosses, to even the NPCs.  The enemys realy look feirce and different.  These graphics truly set the standerd in 1998.Sound:  The sound effects themselves are Spectacular like the flowing water, the clank of a sword hitting a wall or an enemy, the enemy sounds when thay are struck bu the sword or when they are attacking, Lniks yelps, and much more.  The game features a brilliant musicalll score, Koji kondos work is reminiscent of John williams almost, and that is not a comparison I make lightly.  You will hum the beat of the lost woods, love the powerfull melody of the temple of time, be entranced by the song of storms, there is just so many great melodys that I have lost count.  The song of time is truly memorable as well as all of the others.  My only complaint might be the lack of the traditional overworld thing and Navis annoying hey listen screams, but these are all tossed aside once you hear Koji Kondos work at its finest with the lost woods theme and song of time.Replay Value:  I still play this game nonstop.  It truly proves that Amazing agameplay oulives any other aspect of a game.  There is just so much to do and so much to see and so many places to explore that you will never want to drop the conntroller.This game is My favorite game of all time and is a must buy for any N64 owner, or enouph of a reason to get one if you do not have one already.  It is also avalible on the Wii vertuall console and is well worth the download.  This is the game of my Childhood and I cannont stress enoph how much you need to get this game.',\n",

I must say that Zelda:The Phantom Hourglass for DS Lite was the most fun game I've played on my DS Lite to date. I wish all my DS Lite games were as entertaining as this game was for me.While the game is not overly complicated to play, looking for treasures and solving the puzzles were fun. Every once in a while some extremely clever uses of the DS Lite unit itself help to solve some of the riddles. I enjoyed solving them. Fights were challenging but not impossible.I was able to complete the game and I am very satisfied. I have not found all of the gems or hooked the biggest fish. (Yes, you get to fish in this game too, similar to the Wii game Twilight Princess.) So I'm  going through the lands and seas again to go find what I missed the first time around.The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is a fun and entertaining game. Highly recommended by this mom for her own game time fun.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Pros:+Reissue of one of the best Playstation 2 games.+A good storyline+A beautiful and stylish game+Incredible soundtrack+Wii Controls work wellCons:-There aren't any Wii Exclusive Extras-No voice acting, though this isn't a big issue-If you own this game on the Playstation 2, the new controls probably don't justify buying the gameIn 2006, Capcom released Okami.  It's a game that didn't have a long lifespan, despite being on the PS2.  It has commonly gone on to be labeled one of the most underrated (and probably underplayed) games of all time.  However, it quickly garnered a cult following.  For anyone who missed the Playstation 2 version, here's a chance to play it on the Wii.  Even if you played the Playstation 2 version to death, Okami on the Wii is worth giving a try.You play as Amaterasu.  She's the Sun God of Japan and must now save the it from being overtaken by an evil curse that has spread across the land.  Amaterasu is joined by her companion Issun.  The overall story of Okami is brilliant.  It's told through text dialog with no voice acting to speak of.  While there's some garbled gibberish going on when the words appear on screen, there's no voice acting whatsoever.  This is forgivable, though.  What may throw some people however, is that some of the games cutscenes are pretty long, and they're pretty text heavy.When it comes to graphics there are some games that put style over substance and some that put substance over style.  Okami manages to do both.  Not only is the game one of the most beautiful looking games ever released on a video game platform, it's also incredibly stylish, colorful, and detailed.  Despite being released in 2006, Okami still manages to be one of the best looking games out there.  Even today, there are few games that look as good as Okami does.  From time to time you may just want to stop your progress and admire the game's beauty.In terms of gameplay, Okami is very reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda games.  You'll go into dungeons and villages and battle bad guys and solve puzzles most of the time.  Combat itself is fairly simple, and the Wii controls are actually pretty good here.  You'll flick the Wii Remote to attack and you can use the Nunchuck to dodge.  For the most part, the controls are pretty similar to The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.  Combat is also pretty simple.  Even against the bosses.  It's very unlikely you'll die even once through Okami.  The biggest draw to Okami, however, and the main reason it makes sense to release this game on the Wii, is the Celestial Brush.The Celestial Brush is more than just a gimmick.  You'll need it to get through much of the game's moments and you'll find you have to use it very often.  Using the brush you can do things like, make the sun come out when it's dark, or cut through stone.  You'll gather more skills as you traverse through the game.  You'll even need to use it in combat to defeat enemies.  What makes the Wii Version so much better is that actions with the celestial brush can be executed much faster than could be done on the Playstation 2 version.  The moment you start using the Wii Remote as a paint brush, you probably won't want to go back to using an analog stick for the task again.If there was any problem concerning the gameplay, it would be that the controls take time to get used to and that they do not always respond.  The controls work well, but stringing together attacks can be a problem sometimes.  When you finally get the rhythm down, though, the controls are pretty solid.There may not be any voice acting in Okami, but there is a fantastic soundtrack at work.  There are still few games that sound as good as Okami does.  Part of what helps the music, however, is that it really gets you absorbed into this world.  More so than most video games.  The adventure also lasts for quite some time, but it isn't boring and just when you're positive you've mastered everything there is to master, the game throws in another mechanic to keep it interesting.The only major thing holding Okami back, really, is the lack of Wii exclusive extras.  It's worth trying the game if you played through the Playstation 2 version.  On the other hand, it might not be worth buying just for the controls alone if you've still got your original copy.The good news, however, is Okami has aged well.  Even by today's standards, the game is fresh.\",\n",

I have to say first off getting this was such a pain it is so popular that hardly any store had it in stock but I finally lucked out. Inside the box you had the Wii console,one wireless remote and nun chuck set,a power and video cables,a sensor bar,and finally a multi sports game disk.You'll find putting this together is pretty easy it finds the remote easily and the sensor bar for tracking the movement of the remote worked great as well.  The console has a wireless network for it to go online for updates or to shop at the nintendo wii virtual store if you have a computer most people realize you have to give the console an IP address as well as Default Gateway and Subnet Mask especially if you have multi-computers networked to you're modem. I myself first tried to have the console find these addresses automatically but ended up having to do it manually especially for the IP address.  After that was taking care of though it found the updates easily and I was also able to shop online at the wii virtual store.  The console allows you to play you're gamecube games as well and you can play the old nintendo,super nintendo,sega genesis,or nintendo 64 games you downloaded from the virtual store.  The wii plays great and I have already gotten such greatgames such as Super Mario Party 8,Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess,and Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix  the games play great and they read the remote and nun chuck controls excellently.  The video is good but don't expect quality like the Xbox 360 or PS3 the wii has the lowest video graphics of these three systems that by no means lessens the quality of this system but again don't expect breakthrough video on thesegames to much.  So I say if you can get this system as soon as possible and if you can find one in a store since their still selling like crazy...GOOD LUCK\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Let\\'s face it, Super Smash Bros Brawl was without a doubt one of the most heavily anticipated games of this year. With heavyweights like Metroid, Mario and Zelda, Nintendo\\'s machine was sure generating some good momentum but those games were more for the hardcore single player whereas Brawl\\'s strengths best come when you\\'re amongst friends that can play. Maybe it was because of that that I was reluctant to purchase it since I always played the machine by myself with no one to really call or was not too busy. But first playing among family members, the appeal of the game/series became easy to see. The single player is fun but to best get the game\\'s positives, bring some friends.Story: No real story to speak of unless you take on the main single player mission which is quite long but the game\\'s more a party game where you and up to 3 other players can battle each other or team up in certain special stages. As such, the game might not be as fun if it\\'s just simply you although like the others in the series, the unlockables which contain trophies to new stages and characters, there\\'s a lot to uncover within the game.Graphics: Of course there\\'s an upgrade from Melee with more sharper character models, flashy effects like lighting, explosions and such but when you stack it against gorgeous games like Mario Galaxy or Twilight Princess, it\\'s not really the most prettiest Wii title but then when you\\'re fighting enemies, you can kind of care less about whether something isn\\'t as sharp as it should be.Sound/Music: The music quite surprised as the game kicks off with a big cinematic intro complete with huge choirs and heavily orchestrated arrangements and throughout the game you can hear music that resembles the stage such as the Overworld Theme from Legend of Zelda to even those quirky songs with strange singing from Animal Crossing. Voice acting is just stuff like laughing, grunts and catch phrases from various fighters.Gameplay: The game hasn\\'t really changed from the previous incarnations as far as controls but you can decide how you want to play: the traditional Wiimote/Nunchuk combo, Wiimote sideways NES-style, the Classic Controller or a Gamecube one. The moves are still relatively similar with minor changes according to the controller. Once you get the hang of how to fight, it\\'s just a case of choosing your fighters. And like a lot of sequels, it adds and adds though that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a bad thing. With returning favorites like Link, Mario and the Ice Climbers, we also get newbies like Sonic, Snake and Zero Suit Samus. Some are incredibly fun to use (Meta Knight) while others don\\'t really seem that exciting to use. Never did like the Fire Emblem guys in the last one and still don\\'t.Game modes are a-plenty from the Classic Adventure mode to the long Subspace Emissary where you can switch to different characters depending on the next \"chapter\" and friends can even join in on the fly so it\\'s not just a single player or multiplayer experience right to the end. You get traditional fights to tournaments to specialty stages like survival mode and plenty more so you\\'re bound to be busy for quite awhile. And let\\'s not forget the most anticipated part: the online feature where you can head-to-head against people hooked up to the Net. I haven\\'t had my Wii hooked up so I can\\'t really give any details but it sure sounds like fun.I\\'d very much recommend Brawl even if it\\'s just you but to get the most out of it, it\\'s best to play with someone. Who knows? Maybe your parents can turn out to be ***-kickers.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"During the past year, Nintendo really showed what it takes with the success of the Wii. Dominant games like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess and the definitive Super Mario Galaxy, really proved the Wii with its ultimate gameplay. But, that success has also been as a dominant question with Super Smash Brothers Brawl. While its prequel, Smash Brothers Melee was the biggest-selling title from Nintendo's last home console, the Gamecube, many still had wondered if Nintendo was going to be able to top that outrageous game of madness and excitement. Well, Nintendo has done it, and taken the brawl to a whole new level of fierceness. Its time to brawl!!Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Nintendo Wii, is one of the most anticipated games to be released this year, and it absolutely dominates the competition. The gameplay is very addictive as you play with all your favorite classics characters like Mario, the adorable Yoshi, Link, the fierce Bowser and many others. There are also a lot of new characters here to unlock too like Sonic The Hedgehog, Wario, King Dedede from Kirby's Dream Land, Diddy Kong and Olimar from the overlooked Pikmin series. There are also secondary characters which have been added as well, that come and assist you to the depth of the gameplay like the Nintendogs, which block the screen so you can't see where your opponents are during the game, and Andross from the Star Fox series. The graphics look great, and appeal to each and every level you can challenge on from the abstractism of Warioware, to the madness of racing along the Mario Raceway from Mario Kart. Each level is packed with excitement for gamers of all ages.The control is also new to some gamers, and traditional for veterans too, as you can manuver your favorite characters 4 different ways: the Wii Remote alone, the Wii and Nunchuck controller, the Wii's classic controller and even the Nintendo Gamecube controller. The Wii controller and nunchuck take awhile to get used to, but the classic and Gamecube controllers work very well, making it simple and addictive gameplay. On top of that, you also can now challenge against others not just in the living room, but you can now also play against other Brawlers online through Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection, which makes the gameplay even more addictive for anyone who wants to brawl farther than they've ever done before.All in all, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is a must buy for anyone who owns the Nintendo Wii. It is just great from start to finish and brings in every depth of excitment and gameplay for a super smash for anyone who has the need to smash the competition. It is definitely a great game all around and a great addition to your Wii video game library.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: A for Gamecube and Classic Controller; B for Wii Remote & NunchuckFun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo gamers; A for multiplayer actionOverall: A-\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'This review was written by my son, James Shea.Koei is famous for games that take liberties with historical events (see also the Dynasty Warriors and Kessen games), and now they\\'ve turned their attention to the Hundred Years War. Despite the questionable accuracy of the history involved, Bladestorm is nonetheless a fun, solid game that introduces a lot of unique game mechanics different than any of Koei\\'s other games.As indicated by the name, Bladestorm takes place during the Hundred Years War, and features many of the personalities present at the time: Joan of Arc, Edward the Black Prince, Henry V, and so on. The historical accuracy is not especially important, however; there are a multitude of fictional characters added in to make things more interesting. Furthermore, the unit types encountered in this game are not exactly accurate: from simple soldiers like pikemen and swordsmen to the more exotic like camels and samurai to the outright fantastic like wizards. Really, the background just provides an excuse to have one side be the \"red\" side (England) and the other be the \"blue\" side (France), as other than specific personas there is really no difference between the two.The player takes the role of a mercenary (whose gender, face, voice, and name can be customized) who fights for both sides. In addition, there are many other mercenaries with whom you work with or against, depending on the job. If you take a job with England, for example, your fellow mercenaries may take a job with you or choose to fight for France. In this way, your enemies are constantly shifting and changing. There are ten huge regions of France unlocked during the course of the game, each with at least thirty towns and settlements. These locations may belong to either England or France, and most of your missions revolve around capturing a town and/or defending a town. Taking a lot of missions for the same side in the same region can affect the balance of power in that region, at which point you can opt to fight for the other side and conquer it all back.The gameplay is the most unique part of the game. The mercenary does not fight alone; rather, he takes command of a unit of soldiers (between 5 and 30). These soldiers can be regulars found on the battlefield, or mercenaries hired and summoned to fight for him. Regardless of which it is, the mercenary must have the proper instruction book for the unit to know how to use it. Furthermore, using a unit will level up that unit type. For example, the mercenary must have the book Swords to use any sword infantry, which includes one-handed, two-handed, sword-and-shield, and dual-sword. The specialties are unlocked through tomes, or sub-volumes to the larger books. Defeating enemies with a unit type gives them experience, which is used to buy upgrades to the unit. Depending on the type, this can be in attack power, defense power, troop number, or movement, as well as others. The unit types also have different strengths and weaknesses, as well. For example, pikemen are one of the best infantry against horse riders of any kind, but suffer against other infantry. In contrast, swordsmen are very good against infantry, but not so good against cavalry. A mix of units and proficiencies is required to succeed.The unit itself is handled in the following manner: there are three special attacks, and a \"fight at will\" option. The special attacks include temporary strength or defense increases, raising shields to guard against enemy attacks, and even more exotic techniques like shooting blasts of energy. The \"fight at will\" option makes all the soldiers in your unit charge at the nearest enemy. Movement is controlled with the left analog stick; the soldiers do not have a formation, per se, but tend to stand in two boxes in front of the mercenary to guard him from the front and sides.Unlike Dynasty Warriors, your allies are often fairly important in Bladestorm. Columns of troops, consisting of several types of squads, will set out from towns to attack nearby enemy towns (marked on the map as a large arrow going from one town to another). Players can join up with these columns to strengthen their own cause; while the mercenary may not get as much experience, he or she is covered by the diversity of units present. Capturing an enemy town requires the player to either slay a certain number of guard units or for an allied unit to enter the town (another advantage to traveling with allies). However, no allies can be commanded in the game; the player is a mercenary, not a general.The graphics in this game are fantastic. Especially considering the wide variety of units and the number present on the screen, there is a huge amount of detail and effects on each soldier. The character designs range from feasibly accurate to ridiculous, but all are decently done. There is also a wide variety of armor for the player to buy, with many of the designs seeming reminiscent of games like \"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\". The one complaint I have in this field is the large amount of effects that cover the game (thankfully, the damage numbers that pop up when anyone takes damage can be turned off). The sound is sweeping and epic, but doesn\\'t distract from the game. The voices for the mercenary (three male, three female) quickly become familiar, though the ranges that can be picked are kind of wide considering how few there are.As a whole, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It\\'s fun, it\\'s well-done, it has good AI (not once has my unit ever become stuck on a wall, though allied units have done so once), and the only thing I can really say that\\'s bad about it is the fact that it tried to be historically accurate at all. They should\\'ve just made it a fantasy game, so nobody would have to worry about the fact that there are ninjas and wizards present.Rating: 9/10.',\n",

The orchestrated soundtrack, beautiful, The colors, brilliant, the game, Mind bending Fun! Art is something that either brings enjoyment or changes the way we see and/or feel, perceive, or it does both, and at least for video games this accomplishes both triumphantly. M. C.

It's like a trip to the Magic Kingdom, a ride on a roller coaster, a beautifully animated movie, This game is like other Classic Video Games, like other Classic Mario games, and in the future even after there is another Nintendo people will seek this game out to experience what is sure to become a timeless Classic.Is this the best game ever? Is this the best game of this current generation of consol gaming? Maybe to both but who can really answer such a question because opinions and tastes differ but what 38 professional video game reviewers and I agree on is this is one of the best Must play video games on the market today.If there is any higher praise then this is it, this is worth buying a Wii for and if you already have one then this game should be without question at the top of your buy list.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"When it comes to anticapated games for the Nintendo Wii, many of them have wanted one thing, Mario. It has been nearly a year though since the Wii was launched with The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess as the main attraction, but many die hard fans have been anxious for a game that has delivered the appeal of Super Mario 64 from Mario's hay day. Although Super Mario Sunshine was also a fun game for the Nintendo Gamecube, it just didn't deliver as well as the Nintendo 64 classic had proven. But, Mario has proven his strength earlier this year on the Wii with gems like Super Paper Mario & Mario Party 8 which both worked well as great buys for the Nintendo system, but this is the one that reaches to the stratosphere.Super Mario Galaxy for the Nintendo Wii, brings in the big guns, as Mario does whatever it takes to save Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach from the clutches of Bowser. This time around, Mario takes to the sky to help him in his quest. Along the way, Mario has to collect star bits, which can help him beat enemies and bosses of all kinds, from the classics like Thwomps and goombas, to bigger than life boss battles like a vulgar spider who shoots venom at you, and even a mecha robot that fires bullet bills at you from all different angles.There are also a few new features here that Mario shines through as well in the game, like specialty suits like the bee suit, which transforms Mario into a bumble bee, that can make mario fly through the Honeycomb stage, where he can collect coins and stars from each of the levels. There is also the boo suit, where Mario can actually become the ghostly menace, Boo in the haunted house level to help him enter ghostly portals that Mario couldn't normally enter, but it also can make the other Boo ghosts quickly fall in love with Mario in the blink of an eye. There are also some returns of classic items to use as well like the Fire Flower, and a new ice flower that Mario could use to freeze his foes on ice.The graphics in the game are absolutely breathtaking and appeal well to the Wii's eyes, while the music is simplistic and elequent to the ears of Mario fans, especially as he surfs the galaxy. The control is also very simple to manuver, and stays mainly relevant to the palms of the Wii remote and nunchucks' hands. You can also use the Wii remote to help you grapple onto trees and meteors that can help you launch from one platform to another, and you can also use to help you collect star bits, and perform new attacks like the spin move. There is also a new co-op mode where for the first time, two people can play, as you can use another player to help you collect star bits, to help you along your quest, and defeat tougher foes like a giant octopus in the lava, and even giant goombas that are beyond the heights of the world.All in all, what I love about Super Mario Galaxy is that it is everything Wii owners have wanted in a great game, and more. It is a definite must buy for the Wii that is sure to bring a lot of excitement into die hard Mario fans. This is one game that really brings out the heart at being the best of what the Nintendo Wii has delivered, and that has still shown to die hard Mario fans of all ages. I absolutely recommend it as a great buy on a star-spectacular scale.Graphics: ASound: A+Control: A-Fun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Like a lot of franchises, the Legend of Zelda tends to add a couple of different gameplay mechanics to make it feel like a different game, but fundamentally you\\'re still getting the same thing. But when you have the \"if it ain\\'t broke...\" adage fitting perfectly, one can understand Nintendo\\'s reluctance to completely overhaul the series. With Phantom Hourglass, it\\'s kind of like Minish Cap-style presentation with some of the more unique controls found in Twilight Princess. Does it make it a great game? Well it certainly does have the classic gameplay but it might not have the classic status of Ocarina of Time or even an underrated one like the Oracle series.Story: Taking place a couple months after Wind Waker, Link is onboard the pirate ship with Tetra when they come across a mysterious ghost ship. Mind on treasure, Tetra goes onboard only to disappear and Link thrown overboard. He arrives on an island and with the help of a ship captain, Linebeck and a fairy named Ciela, Link searches for the ship to save his friend.Graphics: Some might find it similar to Final Fantasy III\\'s DS remake but that doesn\\'t mean the graphics are bad. In fact, this is probably some of the most detailed and lively graphics on the DS. It really does have that kind of \"miniature Gamecube\" feel in some of the scenes.Sound/Music: Zelda at times had the best music when it stuck to the familiar themes. Not saying the music\\'s bad here, of course not, but there\\'s times where you like the music playing but there really isn\\'t that distinctive theme until you go \"hey wait, is that a remixed version of Zelda\\'s Lullaby?\" But maybe it\\'s just me.Gameplay: Last time it was changing into a wolf, now, um, well there is the titular hourglass. Beating bosses fills up the hourglass a bit which allows more time to complete the dungeon of the Ocean King. Getting more items allows further access into the dungeon. It\\'s a nice idea but it would nice if we didn\\'t feel like going through the floors again in order to get to the next section. There is a halfway point but it would be nice if you can \"zap\" to the next section.Along with Twilight Princess, this is probably one of the most different in terms of controlling Link. Done entirely (let me repeat, ENTIRELY, no control pad here) with the stylus, Link at times even controls better. Instead of locking in, you just tap the enemy and Link lunges with his sword; do a swipe and he\\'ll horizontal slash or draw a circle around Link and he\\'ll spin dash. Even using items like boomerangs and bombs are funner to use thanks to user-controlled flight paths for the former or precise throwing for the latter.It\\'s moving Link around the field that feels unpolished. Have the stylus farther away from Link and he runs, closer and he\\'s slower or draw circles on the outside of the screen and he\\'ll roll. There are times where you fall off cliffs because you pushed too far away, causing a sprint rather than a walk and rolls can be a pain to pull off. There was also a couple times where you have bomb flowers and pointing to them has Link pick them and instead you sword swipe them, causing them to explode in your face.The sailing\\'s more easier now. You just draw a path on your map and take a breather while firing a cannon now and then at enemies. However, it\\'s this streamlining that might bug players who don\\'t like the decrease in difficulty. Gone are the days of Link to the Past and the Oracle series where you can get easily stomped if you\\'re not careful, Minish and Hourglass have a more accessible difficulty where you\\'re not cursing the game because of one frustrating dungeon - Water Temple, anyone? - but still, the game depends on your skill as a Zelda gamer. Newbies can easily grasp it eventually while veterans might find the lack of difficulty disturbing. (heh heh, Star Wars reference).If you\\'ve beaten Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass will easily tide you over. It\\'s fun, not challenging and probably not the best Zelda recently but it\\'s Zelda and that means enjoyable gameplay.',\n",

Certainly we got good games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and we got a ton of mini-game compilations, but for the most part, the Wii has been getting mini-game compilations, ports with tacked on Wii controls, and games that were originally slated for the Gamecube.  Now we've finally got a high quality Wii game built from the ground up: Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.  Nintendo once again sets the bar.  Metroid Prime 3 is not only fun and easy to get into, but the controls are just an intuitive as ever.The game begins when Samus returns to Galatic Federation Station Olympus, a base of operations.  She's there to report for duty to Admiral Dane, as are other bounty hunters.  It appears the space pirates are up to no good as they've planted a virus in a series of the Galatic Units super computers, the Aurora Units.  Just as Admiral Dane is explaining how the bounty hunters must go and neutralize the virus, Olympus comes under attack.  It's time to suit up, escape Olympus station and get started on your mission.  Samus is not alone through her journey, as she has the help of other bounty hunters as well.  No, you won't get to play as any of them.You'll begin the game with a fairly basic arsenal.  Your power beam at your disposal, along with your morph ball and bombs for your morph ball.  As is usual for the Metroid formula, you'll get several upgrades along the way.  Including missiles, grapple beam, upgrades for your power beam and morph ball and a plethora of other upgrades.Playing the game itself is fairly simple with the Wii Remotes controls.  Using the joystick on the nunchuck you can go forward, backward, strife left and right.  Pressing the C Button goes into morph ball mode.  Pressing and holding Z locks you onto an enemy target.  Pressing A on the Wii Remote is how you'll fire your weapon, while pressing B makes you jump.  You can turn Samus by simply moving the cursor on screen via the Wii Remote left or right.  It's all pretty basic and all pretty simple.  The 1 button pulls up your map while the 2 button will supply you with hints to your objective.  These controls are pretty tight and simple to learn.  The game will also help you out every step of the way by providing hints to help you out.  It can sometimes feel like the game is holding your hand, but if you really want to go at things on your own, you can turn the hints off.  If at any time you have trouble with the controls, you're able to change them.  You can also change the sensitivity of the Wii Remote.How the game uses motion sensors, however, is where it gets innovative.  Throughout the game you'll have to pull switches or press in switches.  While Samus will interact with some things on her own accord, there are plenty of moments when you'll have to do it.  For example, at the very beginning of the game, you'll have to control Samus's hand movements with the Wii remote and make her press buttons.  Later you'll have to pull switches by pulling the Wii Remote back, and then turning the same switch clockwise (or counterclockwise)  and then pushing it back in.Even more engaging is using the grapple beam.  To use the grapple beam you'll have to flail the nunchuck forward and then pull back to flail whatever it is your targeting.  You can only target specific things, however, and usually the game will provide you with an icon to let you know.  This is also essential to the gameplay as you'll also encounter enemies who use shields and you'll have to use your grapple beam to take them away before you can damage them.A lot of your weapons and accessories will receive upgrades as you go through the game.  New to Metroid Prime, however, is hypermode.  Soon in your adventure you'll get the Phazon Enhancement Device (called a PED).  This will allow you to enter hypermode.  While in hypermode your attacks become more devastating.  You can't stay in hypermode forever, though, and while it's a great asset to you, it'll cost you one full energy tank to transform, so you'll have to watch your health.As with previous entries in the series, though, Metroid Prime 3 wants you to scan things.  Switching to the scanning visor is easier than ever here.  Just press and hold the minus button and you'll be able to switch to the scan visor easily and scan your targets using the Z button.  Like previous Metroid Prime games it plays a part in completion.  Here it isn't just for completion, but also to access unlockables.  Throughout the game you're awarded credits.  Red credits, blue credits and gold credits.  Most of these credits (such as the red and blue) will be earned through scanning.  Red credit are obtained when you scan new creatures, blue when you scan new lore and gold is awarded when you meet special conditions such as defeating a boss.  You can also obtain credits in others ways, such as saving allies in distress.  The game also presents friend vouchers to you, and these are also acquired through meeting special conditions as well as getting lots of kills throughout the mission.  Friend Vouchers are useless on their own, but send them off to friends and they'll instantly become friend credits for them.  If you want friend credits, have a friend send you friend vouchers.The credits will grant you access to some of the games galleries, like the concept gallery, the bonus gallery and the soundtrack gallery.  There are tons of extras and a ton of scanning to be done to get them.Another aspect that Metroid hasn't changed.  Throughout the game there are missile expansions and energy tanks for you to collect and the game keeps track of all your pickups.  For completists this is perfect.  As you don't have to get all, but getting to some of them can be a challenge.  This is what is so nice about Metroid, it encourages exploration.  However, you won't find yourself lost ever.  The game is very good about telling you what to do next and where to go, and the in game map is also detailed about it and puts your objective there.  So even if you decide to explore, getting back on the main path is no hassle. One crucial thing the Metroid Prime series has suffered through, however, is how they use their save rooms.  They're too few and far between and Metroid Prime 3 is no exception.  It's a pain to complete an objective, but be too far from a save room and then die because of a surprise attack from a group of enemies.The games boss battles are monumental, though.  Each boss battle is a memorable one and makes the gameplay intense.  Mostly because many bosses you have to meet certain conditions before you can actually damage them.  This adds a bit of strategy to many of the battles.The environments here are beautiful looking, at least, and huge.  Absolutely fantastic.  In terms of showing us what the Wii can do, this is a good start.  By far it's the most beautiful looking game on the system to date.  The environments are detailed as are your enemies who will hunt you down.  The game also doesn't suffer from any framerate issues or long load times. The game also sounds breathtaking.  Almost every part of the sound is a winner.  The sound effects are perfect, and the background music is brilliant.  Some tunes are remixed from previous Metroid titles (notably Super Metroid), while all the new stuff is just as good.  The voice acting is also brilliant.Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a brilliant game.  Well worth the wait.  The amount of time put into the game shows.  Hopefully we'll see more games like it in the future, and ones that make as good of use out of the Wii Remote as this one did.Pros:+Gorgeous graphics+Fantastic soundtrack+Good voice acting+Tight intuitive controls+Intense boss battles+Lots of bonus content+Huge maps to exploreCons:-Save rooms are too few and far between\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"The Legend of Zelda is one of my favorite video game franchises of all time. So one should expect that I would be singing praises up and down for the latest entry to arrive on the Nintendo Wii system, right? Well... yeah, pretty much.While every Zelda game to date has been a hit in my book, I haven't been truly blown away ever since Ocarina of Time first hit the Nintendo 64. I had high expectations for Wind Waker when it first arrived on Gamecube, and although it was an enjoyable game, it just didn't meet the high standards that were set by its previous entries. However, that all changed on November 19, 2006 when both the Nintendo Wii and the new Legend of Zelda released simultaneously. Like a kid on Christmas morning I hooked everything up the moment I got home and was launched into a role-playing haven to the likes of which I've never seen.You start the game off slow in a small village that Link calls his home. Here you are introduced to the game, its characters, and everyone's favorite mode of Hyrule transportation: Epona. After spending a bit of time in the village, the game kicks into high gear and you are changed into a wolf with new abilities that completely turns the world of Zelda upside-down. From here on out, you realize that you are destined to save the world, animal form or not, and must do so by navigating a line-up of cleverly designed dungeons.I had not played an X-box 360 or Playstation 3 prior to trying out this game, so to me, the graphics were outstanding. This is the first time in the history of the series that I felt like the game was alive, with well designed character models and astounding lighting effects. It should also be worth noting that this game has a much darker, more realistic feel to it, which is a sharp contrast to Wind Waker's cel-shading effects which came before it.The soundtrack for this game is superb as well. All the tracks were wonderfully orchestrated and have that classic Zelda flavor that has been a staple for the series since the beginning. The only disappointment here is the lack of voice work that has been done for the game aside from the short voiceovers that play when talking to a character, but this is nothing new and does not retract from the enjoyment of the game.Playing this game with the Wii remote is a major draw for this title. With the exception of playing with a plastic sword as a child, this is the first time I got to imitate Link's sword fighting skills without feeling like an idiot. Although you may look silly to your friends and family that happen to pass by as you are flailing your Wii remote in the air, you will be having far too much fun to care. I think having the controls done in this manner also helps reduce the amount of buttons required to control the game. All you need to do is wave the Wii remote to swing Link's swords, and waving the nunchuk gives you access to spin attacks and shield blocks. In addition, the remote makes sounds during combat that help reinforce the feeling that you are actual engaged in sword combat.We are slowly entering the HD era of gaming, and with that in mind, it may seem like the Wii will lag far behind. But if a majority of Wii titles can maintain the sort of quality that is pouring out of this latest Zelda adventure, I think Nintendo's system can hang with the big dogs with the best of them. If you have a Wii, or are thinking about buying one, you should pick up Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. You won't regret it.\",\n",

I played it non-stop, battleing against the Gnorcs, aquiring treaure, ramming through thouse nasty blue thieves for the pink-spotted eggs, getting more life for poor Spyro, and resqueing the dragons locked in stone, of course.Now, I'm playing more mature games. Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games for the Gamecube counsel. Along with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarine of Time/Twilight Princess, and Hitman 2. But after playing thouse games on the sparkling Gamecube counsel, I turned my gaze to the dusty, gray Playstation, and out popped Spyro again!I'm actually replaying the game, I already beaten both of the two first worlds in under an hour. But it is a really good experience to play this old jewel again! I also own four other Spyro games: Spyro: Ripto's Rage, The Year of the Dragon (Both of thouse for my old Playstation and are VERY fun!) along with the alright, but not the same: Hero's Tale, and the crappy game some idiot thought up: The Legend of Spyro: A New Beggining. I despised thouse two games for what they had done to that cool, little dragon we use to know.But, alas! At least I saved my original game for times like these! Please, if you still have your old gray Playstation, (or a Playstation 2) than fish out Spyro from the attic or the closet and replay it! Or, if you are new to the first original Spyro games, go out and buy them! (that is, if you don't mind an extreamly easy game) The game is fun, nevetheless it being easy, it holds that sparkling air that Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64 holds![Sparks, The Dragonfly]Gold = Full HealthBlue = Medium HealthGreen = Low HealthNo Sparks = One More Hit Left-To correct anyone that got Sparks color coded health wrong. ^-^[Spyro, The Dragon]Able to glide short-distancesCan run/ram with his hornsCan jumpCan buckAnd can do the roll to avoid enemy attack (Why didn't they remake that move for all the other games, I ask?)And of course, flame enemies!\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"It has been well over two years since Resident Evil 4 first debuted. It was definitely a milestone for Capcom's now infamous Resident Evil series, breaking away from the franchise's traditional outlook and implementing a more free action-oriented approach along with fresh gameplay additions such as quick action response time as well as buying and selling items. Despite the obvious drastic changes made to the game, it is very much Resident Evil at heart. The puzzle-solving, the herbs, and the typewriters are all still here. And now RE4 graces the Nintendo Wii, creating a new way to re-imagine this modern classic. You play as Leon S. Kennedy who is assigned to rescue the U.S. president's kidnapped daughter in Europe. The Umbrella Corporation is gone, but a brand new evil is about to emerge.A lot of gamers became a bit worried when they realized this would have to utilize the Wiimote, which did not fare too well with other ports such as the disappointing Prince of Persia: Rival Swords. I'll tell you right now, the controls themselves are surprisingly quite intuitive. They are among the best when it comes to responsiveness, in contrast to the sensitivity issues that have plagued other Wii titles. The guys over at Capcom seem to have understood the Wiimote's capabilities well. The graphics, while they haven't gone through any significant change, are still impressive by today's standards. Everything from the detailed towns and caves to the monsters and elemental special effects are a stellar sight to behold. The framerate hardly ever falters either. The music, sound effects, and voice acting are top notch as well. Fans will be happy to know that all the special features from the PS2 version have also made a return here.Seasoned and experienced RE4 veterans may find the new Wiimote play mechanics more of a handicap than anything else, thus making the game a little easier than before. And be warned though. Some gamers, especially first-timers, may grow weary and exhausted too soon due to the amount of action and thrills the game exerts on the player. Now that RE4: Wii Edition requires a little more physical activity, it may turn away those who didn't expect this much tension for a game. A lot of today's games are more action intensive, so hopefully this will just be a minor problem for the most part. Also, some action game purists may be a little disappointed by the fact that you cannot run or strafe while killing enemies, something that has always been a Resident Evil trademark. If you are concerned about violence and gore, then I would suggest you stay away from this product.Such issues aside, for anyone who has never had the opportunity to play the game when it first came out (which I don't consider a requirement in order to play this one), this new edition may prove to be a very fun yet unique roller coaster of a ride. For those who have already played RE4 (on either the GameCube, PlayStation 2, or PC platform), it will serve to be an alternate but far more interactive experience to revisit an already great title. It really is the most well-made game done with a Wii makeover since The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and one of the better titles on the system overall. It's almost as if this game was always meant to be eventually ported over to the console. As an excellent showcase for the Nintendo Wii, it is a good way to tide things over until newer more anticipated games for the system are released later on. The $29.99 price tag also makes this one well worth it.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'I have played many games thoroughout my life. Nurmourous Final Fantasy realeases, traveling through the wonderful world of Magic Crafter\\'s/Beast Makers, etc in Spyro; The Dragon on Playstation; to the wonderful world of Hyrule with Link in: Ocarina of Time on the N64.Now ever since the Gamecube had come out, I had explored new games and new horizons in the gaming/entertainment world. Spyro immediantly went downhill with it\\'s releases of Enter the Dragonfly/Hero\\'s Tail/ and the (somewhat fun but too short and chessy) A New Beggining. Spyro, the cool purple dragon we used to know in Ripto\\'s Rage and The Year of the Dragon had died.While the newest release of: The Legend of Zelda is fun, but doesn\\'t pack that extra punch that Ocarina held. Yes, it was enjoyable. While riding Epona and slashing with a sword then just the old fairie bow made killing enemies fantastic and brilliantly enjoyable, the bosses were far too easy and the game was boring from one part to another. Link seemed a little cheesy, and it just wasn\\'t the same Hyrule we had grown up with in older T.L.O.Z releases.Then there was Soul Calibur II, Hitman II, and more that were fun (also the remastered Super Smash Brothers Melee) were nice. But they just weren\\'t the same, something was missing.I had just picked up Resident Evil 4 a week ago, and couldn\\'t stop playing it ever since. While Twilight Princess was agonizing and boring at parts, having to run around in no-enemy zones, you were constantly kept on your toes to shoot down enemies with the gun-with-nifty-laser, blowing guts, blood, and gore everywhere. The game has kept me playing.While with Hitman II you have to use the stick to constantly move him about, turning him left and right to fix the angle of the screen while shooting down enemies, and picking up consoles, ammo, etc. The game was nice, but having to sneakly come up from behind an annoying person and strangle them silently and drag them into a hidden location just got tiring after a while, plus if you were discovered you were pretty much screwed...But Resident Evil 4 you can freely move about while blasting enimies away with a shotgun, dodging D.NO.MITE, knocking down ladders and commanding Ashley to hide in a dumster while Leon goes ahead and clears the shrounding area of any danger, never get\\'s tiring for me. The nice laser aiming makes it easier to bring down enemies, while in earlier games you had to blindly shoot and hope not to miss. You have to pretty much kill ever enemy you come up against, to claim more ammo, herbs, and money. You no longer freely find weapons lying about to extend your\\'re weapon supply, you now have to buy them from a vieled merchant, whom shows up in frequent parts of the game. And while everbody may say that Ashley get\\'s annoying protecting after a while, I found it easy to keep her safe while Leon kills away with a Riffle or Handgun.Later on you get out of the gloomy forest into the castle area, where you constantly face creepy followers of the strange religion of Straddeler. The only thing that get\\'s boring is having Ashley one minute, then having her suddenly swept away by a monster or getting locked in a trap, to going through long areas that seem to be never ending, facing nermourous bosses, etc... There seems to be no end in sight, and that\\'s what pretty much sums up the entire game.The game is probably the longest I\\'ve ever played, but the graphics are astounding and the role playing is fantastic! Leon\\'s cool American voice to Luis\\'s Sera\\'s Spaniard heart-melting accent really catches the ear. Ashley also has a great voice, but it can get annoying when she\\'s screaming for Leon\\'s help. The bad guys, especially the chanting: \"Mony es-o dee, Mony es-o dee\" will get stuck in your head when you venture into the castle and face the religious freaks of Saddler\\'s dream.Overall, the game is fun and I\\'m rather enjoying it! Leon has got to be the coolest character I\\'ve played yet on any game console. So if you haven\\'t yet played Resident Evil 4, and had just went out and picked up a Wii, do so now, and get the updated, more action packed version! You will have a \\'Hell\\', of a time!',\n",

The people who say this game was dissapointing are obviously ones who are hard to please.Twilight Princess was the fantastic game I expected, no more. The amount of depth put in the game is mind boggling. The people at Nintendo took their time to make the game as polished and epic as possible, and they greatly succeeded. When you take a moment to just look at the game you will be blown away. Most especially if you find a high place in Lake Hylia or Gerudo Desert to look below you and see the scope of the game. Hyrule Field is absolutely huge...and beautiful.Twilight Princess may be a Gamecube game at heart, but the graphics are absolutely wonderful. This game is one of those that starts off looking OK, but as you progress the environments begin to look better and better. Anyone who plays the game will notice that instantly.As for the difficulty level of the game. Well, the game can be a trifle easy. But most who say that are, like me, Zelda veterans and are not looking from the perspective of newcomers. However, I do feel that Nintendo should find a way to make it more difficult for gamers like me and accesible for newcomers. Perhaps in the next Wii installment that problem will be addressed.The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was delayed for a reason. It's one of the most polished and epic games you can play. And you'll definitely get your money's worth because this game is pretty long and will take you a good time to beat. Twilight Princess is a fantastic effor by Nintendo to emulate the magic of Ocarina of Time. It may not have that initial magic we all felt when we played the N64 masterpiece for the first time, but Twilight Princess comes as close as any game can come to perfection.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Super Paper Mario, like the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, was originally a Gamecube game that was moved on over to the Wii. Still, it's definitely a game we've been waiting for and definitely a game worth getting a hold of. Simply put, this is one of the games Wii owners ought to want.The storyline in Super Paper Mario isn't really anything special, but it's certainly one to honor for its fine script and clever writing. An evil magician named Count Bleck plans on taking over the world, and as Mario you'll need to stop him by finding the pieces of the purity heart that'll allow you to do so. In truth, the storyline is actually really crazy, but I'd rather not give too much away. It's actually a really enjoyable story Mario fans will love in the long run.The game is very dialogue heavy but at least its creative. Much of it is very humorous and will have you laughing quite a bit. But when I say dialog heavy, I'm not kidding. You'll be mashing on the 2 button a lot. It wouldn't be so bad if characters didn't go on to explain such things that were useless.Super Paper Mario is truly something remarkable in terms of its gameplay. It mixes Platforming and RPG elements. There's still a need to level up and Mario has his set of HP but all the way, this is a platformer. It plays very similar to Super Mario Brothers on the NES. However, a slight problem with this kind of gameplay, is that those who were really addicted to side scrolling Mario games and were used to holding down a button to run will be surprised to learn there is no button to run! It's no big deal, but if you're feeling nostalgic (as you probably will playing this game) it's actually something long time Mario fans may have to get used to, especially because Mario doesn't move very fast.During the game you can press the A button and flip the screen from the 2D world to the 3D world any time you want. Most of the time you'll be playing the game in the 2D realm, but there's plenty to be done in 3D too. It's a necessity to getting past some of the games puzzles. If you're ever stuck on puzzle just try flipping. It's also used to get past environmental objects. If a pipe is too tall for Mario to jump over, for example, then you can switch the game to the 3D view and simply walk around it. You can't stay in 3D forever. If you stay in 3D for too long Mario will take damage.The problem with the gameplay is that the game is far too easy. Most enemies are easily dispatched and don't do much damage to you anyway. Even boss battles are of little challenge. The boss fights are fun, at least, requiring you to fight them in interesting ways, but they're still on the easy side. If you're an expert gamer, I don't predict you'll die anytime soon throughout your adventure.Mario also isn't alone. He'll be joined by Peach, Luigi and Bowser throughout his travels, and each of them has an ability they can do. Peach can float, Luigi has a high jump and Bowser can spit fire. You can switch between them at any time, and there are moments when you'll actually need a certain character to do things. However, the game relies heavily on the mechanic of going from 2D to 3D and only Mario can actually do this. Despite that you've got other characters, you'll still play through most of the game as Mario.Throughout your adventures you'll also collect Pixls. Little fairy like creatures that give Mario and company other abilities he can use. For example, early on in the game he meets a pixl that allows him to grab enemies and other objects and throw them. There are plenty of other powers. Needless to say, Super Paper Mario is filled with secrets.The wii remote works well with this game. As noted you'll hold it like an NES controller and play the game in basically the same style you played the original Super Mario Brothers. The Wii controls, however, feel a little tacked on. You can point the remote to search for hidden doors or scan enemies. You can also shake when you jump off an enemy to get more points. The wii remote doesn't have a big impact on the gameplay, though.Visually, of course, the game looks like a late generation Gamecube game. However, the games unique style alone warrants its beauty. The 2D landscape is far better looking than the 3D landscape, though. The 2D backgrounds are beautiful, and the background environments really shower a lot of detail. 3D doesn't look as good, though because it's just not as pretty and filled with life.  Most of the level designs themselves are also pretty plain. As far as platforming goes, there's nothing too intuitively designed either. The levels also aren't filled to the brim with enemies. There's a lot of jumping, but not a lot of obstacles in your way.The game also sounds really good. There's no voice acting to speak of, really. Which sucks for a game as text heavy as this, but most gamers who've been gaming for well over a decade probably won't care about this, anyway.On the whole, Super Paper Mario is a must own title for the Wii. It's been ingeniously designed; it's full of humor and has been cleverly written. And to top it all off, it's just a lot of fun to play.Pros:+Well crafted dialogue+VERY humorous game+Strikingly original gameplay elements+Simple easy gameplay to get a hold of+Good music+Plenty of things to do in the game+Cleverly designed puzzlesCons:-The game is far too easy for experienced gamers-Tacked on Wii Remote controls-Very dialogue heavy; it's GOOD dialogue, but there are moments when you really just want to play the game\",\n",

It also works great with games like Excite Truck, where you hold it like a NES controller, and turn it like a steering wheel, or The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, where you could aim your bow & arrow to fire against foes and swing it back and forth to use ot as a sword. I definitely recommend this because it is worth the money, and the gameplay.Price: B+Gameplay: AConvience: A-Overall: A-',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Lets face it, the current generation systems (meaning XBOX, Playstation 2 and the Nintendo Gamecube), are on their way out the door. Some, most notably the Gamecube have forefully jammed their foot in the door and are relenting to move. With the release of The Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess, Nintendo shows that they wanted Gamecube fans to have one last great game before the end comes, which it will. And a great game this is! The Twilight Princess was relased on both Gamecube and the Wii, and the graphics for the Gamecube version rival that of the Wii\\'s!!! However, since the Wii is still in its trial phase, that doesn\\'t really say all that much, just that the Gamecube version is no slouch at all! With THE best graphics to ever grace Nintendo\\'s dying system, the Twilight Princess presents us with smooth looking and \"darker\" graphics. Those of you who have played The Wind Waker and hated the child like animation, fear not! The Twilight Princess\\' graphics are much more \"grown up\" looking and much darker, in both shading, look and feel. While the game still has the same problems that other games do on this system (notably the jagged edges that you will see once in a while in the graphics), the game looks stunningly beautiful and fresh. The controls are good ol\\' zelda controls, so there is nothing to complain about there.On to the game...The story like mirrors the Ocarina of Time, the Zelda game released for the Nintendo 64 (way back in the day). For those of you that have spent much blood, sweat and tears trudging through that challenge, your in for a treat! All of the temples, villages and even the great Hyrule Field make their appearance again, this time revamped in both graphics and challenge. For example, you go to the Gorgon mountain, Zora\\'s temple and the forest temple, just like in Ocarina of Time. And you start off in the same viilage (in the same hut!) as you do in Ocarina of Time. Your horse is the same (Epona). But the graphics are much better looking! The sound  (especially if you are playing in surround sound  digital) is amazing! Everything from chains clanking against the ground, to echos sound true to life and awesome.The dungeons (in my opinion) are much more challenging in a puzzle aspect, however the bosses are somewhat simplistic. I suppose they made the battles easy because Zelda fans range anywhere from 10 years of age and up. Nevertheless, the boss battles are inventive and creative, many of them have left me in awe (wait till you fight the boss of the Gorgon Mine dungeon)!I am about halfway through Zora\\'s temple (not even sure how far in the game that is), and I am still intrigued.Now, don\\'t go thinking that Twilight Princess is an exact port of The Ocarina of Time. No, they have added enough new content to keep it fun and new. For example, following the story of the Twilight Princess, there are \"Twilight\" versions of the world, where you are transformed into a wolf and you have to complete certain missions before you can turn back into human form. And, you have a permanent sidekick named Midna, who is from the \"Twilight\" world and who aids you.I would have to say that sometimes the gameplay when you turn into a wolf seems a little contrived, as if they threw it in just so there would be variation. The wolf missions are all similar (i.e kill a bunch of insects and gather a life force of some sort), but they are fun in their own right. Heck, the graphics and the dungeon missions are worth this game alone!Overall, if you are a Zelda fan, or just a fan of great adventure games, and you own a Gamecube, pick this one up! Even if you don\\'t own one, this game is worth picking up a Gamecube for. They are really cheap these days, and I would recommend you not go without this experience!',\n",

Graphics might not be High Definition, but it looks very close to the XBOX 360 and PS3 when not running in HD mode. And definitively better than the original XBOX and PS2.The game controls are simply unbelievable. Playing Wii Sports (came bundled) for example including (tennis, bowling, baseball, boxing and golf) with the Wiimote is incredible. It is like you actually playing in the game. You need to perform the actions by yourself. I have other games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess with awesome graphics, music, and you have to fight using your sword using the Wiimote. No other console gives you this kind of experience.The console is a solid one and it works nicely and fast. The WiiConnect24 lets you connect to the Internet for playing, shopping, internet browsing (with the Opera browser,. need to be downloaded, watch news or the weather forecast, also you can view pictures using any SD card).Simply an awesome entertainment center.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"As you all know, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was not only a launch title for the Nintendo Wii, but ironically it was the swonsong for the Nintendo GameCube. The only differences between the two is that the lands are inverted, and Link is right-handed in the Wii version instead of left. It was the first game I bought for the Wii, and the first Zelda game I've ever beaten. It took me 50 hours according to the save file, and honestly, as hard as it was, I wouldn't trade it for anything.This game takes place about a century after Ocarina of Time, and Hyrule is once again in jeopardy. A mysterious twilight covers the land, and our main character, Link, who is a farm boy in this game, is thrust into the middle of it. After he is asked to go to Hyrule Castle to deliver a tribute from his village, he is pulled into the Twilight Realm, which transforms him into a wolf. He receives help from a mysterious being named Midna, and soon Link realizes that he must save land of Hyrule from being pulled into the Twilight Realm.That's the story in a nutshell.All things considered, the Wii's unique control scheme combined with the storyline of Twilight Princess compliment each other well. All you have to do is swing the Wii Remote to swing the sword, and using the Hero's Bow has never felt so good. An intuitive control scheme makes this game so great to play. That's not to say that the GCN version isn't great, since it's exactly the same game.I did get frustrated with this game at times, but I enjoyed the hell out of it! The storyline was dark, and sometimes I like it dark. I've played Ocarina of Time and The Wind Waker and while they're both amazing they don't compare to this. Twilight Princess rocks like no other!One of the things I loved about it was that while it took a long time to finish, it never disappointed. The storyline in which Hyrule is being swallowed up by the Twilight Realm is one of the most engrossing and intriguing storylines ever. The fascination with Midna is an integral part of the story, as well as how Ganondorf fits in (yeah, he's here too).The weapons and items were no joke either. The Gale Boomerang, the Spinner (no, not like those on cars), the Iron Boots, and several others I won't name, since it would just ruin it.I warn you. This is not for just any casual gamer. If you buy this and intend to finish it, get ready to put in a lot of hours. I strongly recommend getting the Strategy Guide along with this. If you are a Zelda expert, you may not need it, but considering how long it took me even with the guide, you may need it.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Once again, Nintendo is able to give a stellar addition to the popular Legend of Zelda series.  Despite the fact that the games usually contain the same three core characters (Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf), the games continue to be original.  More importantly, though, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is engaging, challenging, and fun.A few centuries after the events of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the descendents of Link and Zelda, who themselves are also named Link and Zelda (the various games in the series take place across various time periods, with the main characters being represented by ancestors and descendents, all of whom strangely share the same names).  Link is a farmer in a southern province of Hyrule while Zelda is, as always, the princess of Hyrule.  In an interesting move, the people that link lives with may not exactly be Hylians; Hylians, including Link and Zelda, have always been characterized by their pointed elf-like ears, but Link's fellow villagers have rounded ears that we have.The first few tasks of the game have Link dealing with mundane tasks in order to learn the various controls for the game, which, for the Wii version, is extremely important.  However, after being asked to bring a gift to the royal family, mysterious and shadowy beasts show up and enshroud the land in a mysterious twilight.  Link is turned into a wolf while trying to fight the monsters, and is subsequently knocked out and jailed.  While in jail, he meets Midna, who helps free Wolf-Link in exchange for help with a yet-to-be-revealed task.From there, Link and Midna work as a team to rid the land of Hyrule of the strange twilight.  The quest takes Link and Midna to previously seen locales of Hyrule such as Death Mountain (where Gorons live), Lake Hylia, Zora's River (home of the Zoras), and Gerudo Desert.  New places include Snowpeak (home to one of the strangest dungeons I've encountered in a Zelda game) and Link's home of Ordon.As the game goes on, Link's quest takes new turns and has events that are some of the most epic actions I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  While Ocarina of Time was an epic tale overall of how Link, Ganondorf, and Zelda first crossed paths, there are moments in Twilight Princess that seem to be taken directly from The Lord of the Rings.  The final battle of the game is also very well constructed and fun to engage in.The Wii gameplay is amazing.  Swinging the Wii Remote to swing Link's sword, pointing the Remote at the screen to aim the bow, and using it as a fishing rod truly bring the player into the game in ways the traditional control system could never attempt.  It also allows for a much smoother form of horseback combat than that present in the N64 versions (though it was still difficult).  If you have a Wii, I definitely reccomend this version over the Gamecube one (the only downside is a loss of continuity; since Link is usually left-handed, the programmers were afraid that right-handed people, who are the majority, would have trouble using the sword, so they flipped the game around; what this means is that Gerudo Desert is now in the East and Kakariko Village and Death Mountain are now in the West, though in the Hyrule in Ocarina of time, the desert was in the West and Kakariko and Death Mountain were in the East).I have to say that the only thing that I would change about this game is the inclusion (or lack thereof) of magic.  For some reason, even though magic exists, Link does not have a magic meter.  Therefore, there are no spells or magic arrows (or green potions), and the Magic Armor, which makes Link invulnerable while wearing it) is powered by rupees, which can be very annoying.  Still, aside from the complaint, this is an amazing game.  The story is fantastic, the gameplay is top-notch, and the graphics are amazing.  This game may not be as good as Ocarina of Time, but it is very, very close.\",\n",

It has the common go to temples and release the spirits type of plot, but adds its own twists and turns. Each of the temples has its own element and is fun play through and beat the boss at the end. It gives you a feeling of accomplishment when you get through a boss and beat a level of the game.Twilight Princess features a bunch of new weapons that can help you solve puzzles. Sometimes there are puzzles you can't solve without a special item. These can be annoying if you try to do them before you have the item. These items include the Gale Boomerang, the Hero's Bow, the Clawshot(hookshot), and some more items. There are many side quests and extra items to get so that the replay value is very high.The graphics are a little above the Gamecube's best in most places, but in a couple of spots they, although not realistic, are beautiful, full of color and light. There is a section of the game that has gray faded colors to add a dismal desperate look to the world. These places accomplish their purpose well, but aren't as fun to play through.The Wii controls are a very small part of the game. Fishing is probably the time when you most use the Wii controls, but fishing is not a very big part of the game. During the battles you normally just shake the Wii remote a little to attack, but every once in a while it's fun to stand up and do large sword-like slashes with the Wii remote. Although it doesn't use the Wii remote very often it doesn't really need it to be fun.Overall this is a must have game for all fans of the series or owners of a Wii or Gamecube.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Update 15 December 2007:  I still agree with everything said below but now, with a caveat based on a year's experience.  The Wii is a great game system but the games for it are not.  Even more than a year after it's release, most of the games available for Wii are cheap ports of games originally developed for PS2 or Xbox 360.  That's a real tragedy because the Wii is a very solid piece of hardware that has a lot of capabilities that are just not present, as of today, on the other platforms.  In particular, the Wii has 3-axis motion-sensitive wireless controllers, individual sound channels for every controller, Wi-Fi connectivity, and powerful multi-threaded processing capability.  These hardware capabilities are standard on every Wii and yet most of the current Wii games barely use them.  Some examples of what I'm talking about: with its amazing controllers, the Wii should have the best, by far, first-person shooter games on any platform, and yet, most of the FPS games on Wii, with the exception of Metroid Prime 3 Corruption and Medal of Honor Heroes 2, don't begin to use the Wii FPS capabilities.  The Wii should have the best multi-player games of any system because it is, by its very nature, an awesome multi-player system and yet most of the games for Wii are single-player.  Even games that are multi-player on other consoles, such as Call of Duty 3, are single-player on Wii.  With its built-in internet capabilities, the Wii should have a lot of online games but the reality is that only a very few Wii games, such as Medal of Honor Heroes 2 and Guitar Hero 3, have online play.  The bottom line a year after its release is that the few big game manufacturers have mostly trashed the Wii platform with their crappy Wii game implementations.  It's not surprising, then, the best Wii games, such as Super Mario Galaxy and Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess are from...Nintendo.Original Review:Nintendo has redefined video games with the Wii and created a new game experience that makes earlier consoles seem dated.  The Wii is this slim little box with an optical drive and a bunch of cable ports.  The controller is a little boxy thing called a wiimote.  There is a joystick kind of thing called a numchuk that can optionally plug into the wiimote for some games.  The first thing you do when you start playing the wii is create a character for yourself called a mii.  There are a lot of options for skin, hair, nose, height, etc that allow you to make your mii look like a faithful caricature of yourself.  Just creating a mii is fun.  When you've created a mii, you can save it on your controller to use for future games.  Once you have a mii, you start with a game.  wii comes with wii sports that includes tennis, golf, bowling, baseball, and boxing.  All of these games are fun but also give a taste of what future more sophisticated versions of these games will be able to do.  The wii controller is very intuitive to use and amazingly precise and sensitive.  (I wish there was one of these to replace the mouse on my pc.)  The wiimote is very easy to use and is just a lot of fun to play any of the games with. The only negative is that we wish we could buy a couple more of the wiimotes for multiplayer but no doubt these will be available soon.The wii was simple to set up and turn on.  It comes with a built-in wireless card that easily connected to our secure wireless router after asking us to enter our encryption key.  Once online, it downloaded updates automatically and gave access to a lot of other wii stuff.  The wii has been in nearly nonstop use since it was taken out of the box.  The hardware seems very solid and sturdy, unlike our earlier Sony PS2 which suffered from 'disk read error' problems that led to its untimely demise.  I will never spend another dollar on Sony game stuff!We have gotten three additional wii games so far including Zelda and they have all been very good.  The wii has created an entire new game platform that will last for many years and will forever divide games into 'before wii' and 'after wii.'\",\n",

Lake Hylia is gargantuan, Death Mountain just towers above (though it does have a irregular shape) and as for Hyrule Field. well even on your faithful horse, it still takes a bit of time to reach one end to the other (try about fifteen minetes on foot). also, they managed to make the game lengthy (like nearly 50-70 hours of gameplay!). also, i have to say that since this is the first Zelda game to recive a teen rating, it might be a bit much for youngsters. if you have kids that are easily scared, then they should not get this cause the twilight relm is a scary place and there is a very dark story to the game but other then that i dont see how other kids can play. now, for my opinion i say the Wii is the way to go with this version. not only do you get the more realistic way of handling a sword and besides, its Wii. but if you dont have it, Gamecube also works. truly, Twilight Princess is a great swan song for the Gamecube and a great begining for Wii. so to see the birth of a brand new legend, Twilight Princess is the must have for all',\n",

The nunchuck attachment, which is essential to play many Wii games (Zelda for instance) is something to add on to that revolution.The nunchuck is easy to set up.  Simply plug it into the base of the Wii remote and you're ready to go.  The remote uses sensors.  The nunchuck also uses sensors to perform certain actions in games.  In Red Steel, for instance, you'll need to use the nunchuck to knock over tables.  In The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess you'll need to use it to perform a spinning slash attack.On the other hand, the nunchuck is mostly used in games where you'll find yourself having to move your character around.  The nunchuck has a control stick for this reason.  It also has a C button and Z button that can be used in many games. These buttons, as well as the motion sensor, are very responsive.  The better part?  The nunchuck doesn't take batteries.  However, it should be noted that the nunchuck attachment will drain the batteries in your wii remote faster.There is really only one problem that I have with the nunchuck: It's sold separately from the wii remote.  While not every wii game needs the nunchuck attachment, a great deal of them do.  As of this time, Nintendo is not selling the nunchuck and wii remote in a bundle together.  Instead you'll have to buy them separately, and if you buy an additional remote, you may want to buy a nunchuck to go with it.  This can be costly.Still, the nunchuck is a great attachment, and is actually essential to enjoying all of the interative goodness Nintendo's new gaming system provides to gamers.\",\n",

Nintendo shocked gamers worldwide when they announced the eagerly anticipated game would be released for both the Gamecube and the Wii, and then threw another delay on the title.  Well, now, it's here, and chances are, you already know what you're getting here.  If you played the Wii version, you'll find that there aren't many differences between that version and this Gamecube conversion (Link's a lefty here), as it boasts some high-res graphics and the same compelling gameplay that Zelda fans would come to expect.  This time around, Link finds himself protecting Zelda and Hyrule from the Twilight: an evil force threatening the land.  Lucky for Link that when he needs to, he can transform into a wolf.  The wolf gameplay elements are a really nice addition to the classic gameplay formula that has been applied to Zelda games for years: intelligent puzzles, rewarding battles and large dungeons, and a very long and epic quest that just makes Twilight Princess all the sweeter.  The sound design, music, and controls are all wonderfully done as well, and overall the game boasts a kind of polish that hasn't been seen in an original Gamecube game in a long time.

       "   'reviewText': 'This is a review written by someone who has played both versions.  In this review I\\'ll not only touch on the aspects of Twilight Princess, but also tell you a few differences between the Wii and Gamecube versions, because some will most definitely be curious.The Legend of Zelda is one of the most popular games of all time. When a new Zelda game marches forth, the fans are always there. Now, after spending years in development, with delay after delay and ultimately being pushed onto the Nintendo Wii, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is finally here. It\\'s pretty generous of Nintendo to keep the game on the Gamecube as well as pushing it to the Wii.  It\\'s great that even those without the Wii can experience this amazing game.Twilight Princess is by far one of the most instantly absorbing in the series. The game begins with you as Link in the village of Ordan. Things are going well for Link and his friends until a band of monsters riding a boar come and kidnap two of his friends. When Link awakens, he\\'s suddenly thrust into a twilight realm where he meets a creature named Midna, who decides to aid Link on his quest. From the get go, The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess is instantly absorbing. The storyline is by far one of the best in the series and is very engrossing and absorbing.The first major difference between the Gamecube and Wii versions are the controls.  On the Wii you swing the remote and Link swings his sword.  Here, it\\'s just the press of a button.  For anyone who played the Wii version, it\\'s surprising how much time it takes to get used to the control scheme.  When using the slingshot or hero\\'s bow, aiming also feels strange.  It\\'s far easier on the Wii.  The controls for the Gamecube version are good, though.  It\\'s just that if you played the Wii version you have to adjust to it.  However, it actually is an entirely different experienece all together.  This doesn\\'t mean if you have the Wii version you should go out and buy the Gamecube version.  They are, after all, the same game.The heart of the challenge from the game mainly comes from the puzzles rather than the actual dungeon crawl itself. Most enemies are easily taken down by a couple of sword swings.  Some of the puzzles, however, can really throw you for a loop.  This also brings about another key difference between the Wii and Gamecube versions.  The environments are completely mirrored.  In other words, Link holds his sword in his left hand instead of his right.  A path that was on the left in the Wii version will be on the right in the Gamecube version.  Anyone who played the Wii version first will no doubt find this to be rather confusing.  However, most of you are probably getting the Gamecube version because you don\\'t have a Wii.  So this is really no problem at all.A unique twist to the gameplay of Zelda is that Link not only goes around in his normal form, but can become a wolf as well. As a wolf the controls are virtually the same with the exception of Link being able to use senses and dig. You\\'ll also be forced to solve puzzles in wolf form as well, and it does indeed add some variety to the game. As you progress in wolf form, Midna sits on your back and is there to offer advice for you. Gameplay wise, Twilight Princess knows how to keep you immersed in the game.Visually a Gamecube game has never looked better than this.  It\\'s fairly lifelike.  It also looks very identical to the Wii version.  However, the Gamecube version doesn\\'t play out in widescreen so there\\'s letterboxes whenever you view one of the cutscenes.  The game sports some amazing detail, though.  Link has never looked better. The land of Hyrule has never looked better. Your enemies and some of the cinematics also sport some awesome detail.The music still sounds pretty good. A lot of tunes you\\'ll recognize from previous Zelda adventures, but the new stuff sounds pretty good too. There\\'s no voice acting, though, and that still bothers me about Zelda to this day. The Windwaker could\\'ve used voice acting and so could Twilight Princess. The story is so absorbing, and it probably would\\'ve been better had they added voices to it. Link grunts and such and from time to time one of the NPC characters might yell something, but there\\'s really no spoken dialogue throughout the game. It would\\'ve been really exciting to see some of the cinematics brought to life through fantastic voice acting. In the long run this probably won\\'t bother anyone, and its a small price to pay for a game that\\'s as fantastic as this.For what its worth, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is very good. Its by far the most absorbing story in the entire series, and its gameplay is unmatched. Fans who have followed Zelda since its days on the NES will be pleased at just how far the series has come with Twilight Princess. Its one of the best in the series.On a final note, the Wii version is superior to the Gamecube version.  While they are virtually the same game, the controls of the Wii version are better, and some of the environments look smoother.  The control scheme and mirroring of the environments alone makes playing both versions a different experience.  However, if you own the Wii version, this different experience isn\\'t so different as to warrant the Gamecube version a buy.  The reverse is also true.  If you invest in the Gamecube version, it\\'s hard to say, \"Get the Wii version too.\"Whichever version you get, however, you\\'ll be satisfied either way.The Good+Absorbing story+Fantastic Gameplay+There\\'s a lot of great detail given to the game+The puzzles are quite challenging+The game still sounds goodThe Bad-All this time and the series still lacks voice acting',\n",

Swinging the remote makes Link swing his sword. It doesn't take a lot of work to do it either. A simple flick of the wrist is all it takes to make Link swing his sword.  In addition, shaking the nunchuck causes him to do his famous spin-slash attack. The controls are surprisingly fluent and very well responsive. Its an interesting way to play Zelda, and there's no steep learning curve to it.The heart of the challenge from the game mainly comes from the puzzles rather than the actual dungeon crawl itself. Simply because once you do get used to the Wii remote and controls you'll have a pretty easy time getting through the dungeons.  The game provides a targeting system for you, and so you'll find it really easy. Using projectiles like the slingshot is also made easier with the Wii remote.  You simply aim at objects and fire.  If you miss its entirely your own fault.A unique twist to the gameplay of Zelda is that Link not only goes around in his normal form, but can become a wolf as well.  As a wolf the controls are virtually the same with the exception of Link being able to use senses and dig.  You'll also be forced to solve puzzles in wolf form as well, and it does indeed add some variety to the game.

Gameplay wise, Twilight Princess knows how to keep you immersed in the game.Visually its hard to judge Twilight Princess. Its a pretty game, but as you probably expected it pretty much looks like a late Gamecube release. This may be because Twilight Princess wasn't intended for the Wii in the first place, but the Gamecube.  To the games credit though, it has a lot of detail going for it. Link has never looked better. The land of Hyrule has never looked better.  Your enemies and some of the cinematics also sport some awesome detail.  So while it does look like a late generation Gamecube game, keep in mind that it still looks good and that it probably even looks smoother and runs better on the Wii.  Load times are virtually non-existant here.The music still sounds pretty good. A lot of tunes you'll recognize from previous Zelda adventures, but the new stuff sounds pretty good too. There's no voice acting, though, and that still bothers me about Zelda to this day. The Windwaker could've used voice acting and so could Twilight Princess.

       "   'reviewText': 'I camped outside of a store for 8 hours in 36 degree weather for this console, and it was so totally worth it. If you can get your hands on one, do it.Pros:- This system encourages everyone to play because it is fun and easy to pick up, even for non-gamers. The games are catchy and entertaining for everyone. If you are a parent (I\\'m not, I\\'m a college student) most of the games are appropriate for children. Nintendo games are generally much more kid-friendly if you\\'re worried about ESRB ratings. This doesn\\'t apply to all of them (I wouldn\\'t recommend Red Steel for a 5-year-old), so just check the ratings. However, you will find that many of the games are rated E.- It comes with a game already, and it is a darn fun one. Wii Sports is worth playing for hours and hours and is a fun party game. It isn\\'t just some throw-in to try to make the console look more appealing. You do need a nunchuck for Boxing, so if you want 2-player boxing you have to buy another nunchuck and controller. However, the rest of the Wii Sports games just use the wii-mote.- Each person can make a \"Mii\" on their console - A little character that you can make to look just like you! It appears that you can create unlimited Miis and mark one as the \"favorite\". You use your Mii in Wii Sports, and according to the directions your Mii may appear online and in other games as well. They are very detailed and fun to make.- There are great online functions, like being able to play games with others online, having a \"Mii Parade\", and even checking the weather!- You can store pictures on your Wii with an SD memory card.- The Wii has slots for gamecube games, 4 controllers, and 2 gamecube memory cards on a covered panel on the top of the console, so you can play gamecube games.- The games are priced at $50 on release, unlike the $60 Xbox 360 and PS3 games. The console is also value priced much lower than these other consoles and is in much better supply (although since it just came out, you will have trouble finding one initially).- The current games are great, and there is an awesome list of games coming out. Notable current ones include The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (also on Gamecube), Wii Sports, Trauma Center: Second Opinion, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz, and Red Steel. There are also some sports and first-person shooter games for it, mostly interactive. Some notable games coming out later are Elebits (12/15/06), Wario Ware: Smooth Moves (1/15/07), Smash Bros. Brawl (spring 2007, but will probably be pushed way back), and Mario Galaxy.- The controllers are responsive and accurate, so you needn\\'t worry about them spazzing out on you or not working properly. There are no wires to get in your way and you can place the sensor bar above or below your TV screen.- Nintendo values their customers, and if you have a problem with your console (which you probably won\\'t because they only release quality merchandise, unlike Sony) they will send you a shipping label and fix it right away if it\\'s within warranty. I have had experience with this and trust me, it is very good. I had my DS back with a new screen in 3 days last January; it was amazing. You also get an 90-day extension on your warranty just for registering your Wii online.Cons:- As far as extra controllers go, you have to buy each wii-mote and nunchuck extension separately. Right now the wii-mote costs $40 and the nunchuck (sold separately) is $20, and one of each comes with the console already, so if you want 4 full controllers total you have to pay an extra $180! However, you do not need the nunchuck for every game (you do need it for Wii Sports boxing, fyi), and the console does come with one. I sprung for the extra $40 and just bought another wii-mote without an extra nunchuck, and it\\'s still good for a lot of multiplayer action.- The controllers take 2 AA batteries each, and are rumored not to last too long (maybe 20 or 30 hours at best). I haven\\'t had mine long enough to verify this, but since all the controllers take batteries I would recommend buying a rechargeable battery unit.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess has been dubbed one of the biggest launch titles in history, coming out with the Nintendo Wii on November 19th. The game's appearance on the Nintendo Wii was confirmed by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata at E3 `05, and has since been a target of hype and anticipation like no other. Numerous delays-including the delay of the Gamecube version of the game until December `06-have held Twilight Princess back, but rest assured that Nintendo's flagship Wii title is for real. It's not too bold to say that Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the greatest Zelda game of all time, and Ocarina Of Time sits playing second fiddle.Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess takes our hero Link to the land of Hyrule (where else?), where a mysterious and terrifying twilight has taken the land by storm. This twilight is the product of the evil Twilight King Zant, whose shadow creatures begin wreaking havoc on the world. It's up to the blessed Link to save the day, but of course, it's not that simple. Early on, Link enters the darkness of the twilight and is temporarily transformed into a wolf. He also meets a strange character named Midna, a twilight being bent on driving the evil Zant from power. The story delivers on all counts, gripping the player to Hyrule and almost all of its NPCs like no other Zelda game before it. It's dark and twisted for Legend Of Zelda standards; and throughout the story you'll question everyone from Link to Midna to even Zelda herself.Zelda games are all about adventure, and Twilight Princess gives the player a massive world to do all of the adventuring one could possibly want. The world is full of caves, towns, and dungeons to explore as well as lakes, forests, deserts, and mountains. The scope of the game is huge before even considering the hefty amount of things to do. Twilight Princess follows a very familiar Zelda structure, for the most part. Players are thrown into Link's world and eventually a conflict leads him towards a region's dungeon area, where Link will solve puzzles and defeat a boss character to restore peace throughout that region. This game does take the formula a little further; different regions throughout the world will be consumed by twilight throughout the game. Link must enter in his wolf form and seek tears of the region's inhabitants, which restores power to an overseeing guardian who drives away the twilight and restores the area. This extra factor in the gameplay really prolongs the game, but in a good way. Twilight Princess has a pace that never lets go of your attention but yields enough freedom to allow you to explore, which is the point in the first place.Dungeons are a major highlight here, and the developers have mastered level design. Like the rest of the game, they follow a familiar pattern. Each dungeon introduces major challenges, new puzzles, and an important new item that will help you out with the former two situations. This structure has held strong since the series began in 1987, and it is rock-solid here as well. When you come across the bow in the second dungeon, for example, you're bound to use it a lot to solve the puzzles and open up some new areas as well as defeat the boss character. Zelda is very similar to another classic Nintendo franchise, Metroid, in that finding new items can really open up a lot elsewhere in the game. As I mentioned, exploring the world is a big deal in this game, and finding new stuff to uncover nooks and crannies is the trick to finding even more cool stuff.The big controversy over the Nintendo Wii version of Twilight Princess was whether or not the controllers would be able to deliver familiar control mechanics so that Zelda fans wouldn't have to adjust much to a new scheme. Rest assured that Twilight Princess on the Nintendo Wii controls perfectly. That's really all there is to say about it, in general. It feels great, simply put. To go a bit more in-depth, though, you control Link's general movement with the nunchuck's analog stick. Unsheathing and swinging his sword is done with movements of the Wii remote, and for the spinning slash attack, the nunchuck. Z-targeting is back and works as well as it always has, and items can still be used and mapped to different buttons on the Wii remote. Using projectile items is a real treat; items like the slingshot, boomerang, and bow can be fired with the Wii's B trigger and aimed with the Wii remote's motion sensitivity as well as a targeting reticle on the screen. After some practice, defeating enemies, solving puzzles, and simply moving around is as easy as it ever was. Twilight Princess has as much of a learning curve as Ocarina Of Time did, and anyone who's played a Gamecube or Nintendo 64 Zelda game will have no trouble hacking and slashing through minion after minion, stopping only to scratch their head at the next befuddling puzzle or look at the scenery.There are distractions everywhere that strongly support the rumored 70 hours of gameplay. Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess breaks a traditional Zelda mold by forcing you to find 5 Heart Pieces to restore a Heart Container (normally you'd collect four), and as a result, there are 45 of these pieces scattered throughout the world. Fishing was always fun on the Nintendo 64 Zelda titles, but it's an all-new experience here. With the Wii remote, you'll cast the fishing rod, set the hook, and reel in a fish rather than pressing buttons and moving analog sticks. There are 60 Poe souls and 24 Golden Bugs to seek as well as other mini-games scattered throughout Hyrule. If there's not enough for you to do here, well, I don't know what to tell you, because this game's loaded.Twilight Princess is easily the best-looking Nintendo Wii title out of the gates. Hyrule has never looked so beautiful. Link's character model is detailed down to the chain mail protecting him underneath his tunic, and when you see the high towers of Hyrule Castle far off in the distance of the grassy rolling hills of Hyrule Field, it's hard to say the view isn't stunning. The character designs of the last few Zelda games have been superior to most games, but Twilight Princess takes it to a level so high that even those who don't normally appreciate such a thing as art style and design will be impressed. Enemy designs are some of the best in the series, and boss characters are more fearsome than ever before. The twilight structures enemies are very interesting, usually colored in a very dark palette with high-contrast, almost neon-colored designs covering them. Even the different weapons and items look interesting, and are much less conventional than those of previous games. The animation is smooth as silk. Link has no problem keeping up with your flinging of the Wii remote as you slash through keese and other familiar enemies. I was happy to see that some of Wind Waker's effects, like the exploding enemies and flashes of light during battle, were kept intact despite the otherwise polar opposite art direction. It also won't hurt to mention that the game's cut-scenes are choreographed beautifully, making for some of the best story clips I've seen in video games.The music ranges from classic and memorable to completely new, but never leaves the high quality that you'd expect from a Zelda game. If there's anything as familiar as Link's green tunic, the Master Sword, or the Triforce, it's the different sound effects, jingles, and tunes that series veterans could hum in their sleep. You'll hear the familiar theme songs, that little tune that plays when you unlock a door or uncover a secret, and even the same jingle when you open up a treasure chest with an important item inside. There is still very little voice-over, with most of what's there coming from Midna's foreign twilight tongue. While most veterans of the Zelda franchise are happy with this, I would have liked to see other NPCs speak throughout the game. I wouldn't mind if Link remained his voiceless, wordless self, but everyone else could and should be talking.After reading eight paragraphs of praise and little else, you might be wondering: Is Twilight Princess a perfect game? Sadly, it's not, though it's close. It's got a few flaws that keep it at a mortal status, though none of them are detrimental to the gameplay and are easily dealt with. First of all, the sole visual fault comes from slightly blurry textures that show that the game was intended to be a last-generation Gamecube game. Second, some of the alterations to small elements of gameplay bothered me a bit. For example, Link climbs at about half the speed he used to, making those all-too-common vine or grate climbs a major chore. Also, there are several lava, poison, and endless pits that will set you back-sometimes too far back. Early on in the game, you're to follow a monkey holding a lantern through an area filled with poison gas. If you get even an inch too far into the poison gas and away from the safety of the lantern, Link will pass out and return to the beginning of the area. The frustrating part in this specific example is that you battle enemies and can't control the speed of the monkey, so it's entirely possible to return to the starting point multiple times. Last of all, some of the twilight enemies-specifically the shadow minions that you'll encounter often as a wolf-are somewhat annoying to deal with. They present a definite challenge, but eventually they can become quite tiresome.Even with those three gripes I mentioned above, Twilight Princess is a blast to play. It's tough to creatively elaborate on that; it's just fun, and that is the most important purpose of video games. Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess is an epic, and nothing less. It's a game that will test anyone, whether the player controlling Link with the Wii remote is a veteran or beginner. There is so much to do and so much to see that only the definition of time and meaning of life is more perplexing to think about. Nintendo couldn't have kicked off the Wii launch in a better way, but more importantly, they've one-upped a game that is considered by most as the greatest of all time. Ocarina Of Time, eat your heart out. There's a new legend, and it's Twilight Princess.\",\n",

Some might go for holding off, and waiting for the upcoming Wii system, and some other might consider sticking with their Gamecube, and waiting for other great games to come out like Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. There are also those who love thiose handhelds like the Nintendo DS. Since it came out in 2004, it revolutionized the way we actually play video games, with the tip and touch of the stylus. Since then, there have been so many great titles that've exploded for the system including Super Mario 64 DS, Sonic Rush, and Brain Age. Now, a bundle pack is out trying to put the pedal to the medal.The Nintendo DS Electric Blue Mario Kart bundle pack, consists of the original Nintendo DS handheld, not the smaller DS Lite system, and the mad dashing Mario Kart DS. The gameplay for Mario Kart DS is a wild and outrageous game that puts you into Mario, Bowser, Yoshi, and others into the fast and furious video game racer. The graphics and the gameplay are absolutely amazing, as Mario and friends tackle 36 different courses from battle arenas like racing on a actual DS system, to classic courses from Mario Kart past like the Luigi Circuit from Mario Kart: Double Dash from the Gamecube era, or Moo Moo Farm from Mario Kart 64 from the N64 era. There are also numerous unlockables that really makes this game a wild and exciting racer, that defines and surpasses and other handheld racing game.The Nintendo DS also handles itself well, as a convient handheld, with a rechargeable battery for easy convience. The controls, also handle quite well with the simple push of a D-pad, or the simple movement of the stylus, which unfortunately you don't need for playing Mario Kart DS, but for other DS games like Tetris DS. You also have the compatability of the Game Boy Advance as well at your fingertips. If you own GBA games like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3, or Donkey Kong COuntry 2: Diddy Kong's Quest, you can play these great games and others from the GBA library on this great system as well.The only sad note is that for those who love the Nintendo DS, but don't own it, they just wish that the Nintendo DS Lite was used instead of the original Nintendo DS. Nevertheless, that still doesn't change the fun and enjoyment of this bundle pack. The Nintendo DS Mario Kart bundle pack is a absolutely great buy for anybody who wants a great video game system, at a fast and furious price.Mario Kart DS: B+Graphics: ASound: APrice: A 1/2+Control: AFun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A\",\n",

Puzzles, dungeons (which, too, are puzzles), secrets, RUMORS, mini games, AWESOME BOSSES. If this sounds like a formula for winning, you sir, are correct. Because the Legend of Zelda has never looked so fun before. Excuse me though, for I have not played Ocarina of the Time that so many people swear by. But what I do know is that this game is a 10/10 in my book. I am rewriting this review after beating Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, nothing like good ol\\' Wind Waker. I heard that its loose gameplay around the 30 hour mark was criticized by some angry ungrateful reviewers who get paid to write reviews! I am just shocked. This \"loose\" gameplay is the Legend of Zelda evolving from linearity into a masterpiece opting for more of a open world approach while still retaining the awesome flow of story and progression. Besides, I think that was the best part in the whole game. Searching the vast sea for pieces of triforce! So ignore complaints, and set sail into a world of pure joy.

       "   'reviewText': 'I love this game and it is now ranked up there with FFX on my list of awesome RPGs.  I really love this game, it\\'s as simple as that.  I recently bought a GCN solely for the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess that will be coming out soon and was just wandering the aisles looking for anything decent when I happened upon this bad boy.  Everything about Baten Kaitos is ingenious-- battle engine is awesome and intuitive, graphics are amazing, and storyline is incredible.  I\\'m a die hard RPG fan and have grown tired of the same hack and slash, cast magic, heal your party, etc... that\\'s out there.  BK answers the call of breaking through the monotony via a card-based battle system and it works very well.  Leveling seems like less of a chore since every battle is literally different; each time you\\'ll be dealt different cards to use.  The customization of each player\\'s deck is also emjoyable for those who like card-based games.  The utility of time is a really cool aspect.  For example, if you hang on to some green bananas (an attack item at first.  You chuck \\'em at the enemy) they\\'ll ripen and become a healing item.  Hang on to them for too long and they become rotten and their status changes again.  Cards can also be combined to create new cards-- mix up some Light magic with a flower bud and you have a flower, etc...  The manner in which you collect money is the most creative system I\\'ve encountered and I really like it.  You aren\\'t paid for every victory-- you have to take pictures of either the monsters you\\'re fighting or your characters-- and you can only do so if you\\'re dealt the \"camera\" card.  It\\'s a really cool system in my opinion.  Leveling is also done a little differently.  You\\'re rewarded with experience after each battle but it doesn\\'t do any good unless you visit a priest and have him level you up.  All of the small things in this game that have been tweaked from the norm of the RPG genre is what really sets it apart and makes it different-- the reason why I like it so much.  Sound and voice acting don\\'t apply to me since I\\'m deaf, I know that seems to be something that most people are complaing about but it doesn\\'t affect me at all.  The intro cinematic is just breathtaking, the graphics are stunning, and the concept of the world being presented is clever.  Some more CG scenes would be nice but the graphics in the game are good enough to compensate.  Other than that I recommend this title to all RPG fans and GCN owners.  BK is not to be missed.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': '\"New Super Luigi U\" is downloadable content for \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", staring Luigi rather than Mario.  Two months after its first appearance in the Nintendo eShop, priced at $19.99, Nintendo has released the game as a retail boxed version at $29.99, ten dollars more. The DLC version requires you to have the \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" disk in the Wii U to play this extra content.  Obviously, the boxed version can be played as a stand-alone title.Please note: Mario does not appear at all as a playable character.  After beating the game, you can play as Luigi using the standard physics of his brother.To put it kindly, the Wii U has had a rough first year.  The sales have simply not been there, and Nintendo is fighting tooth and nail to get the install base up for their new machine.  One of the key factors has been lack of software titles.  Nintendo skipped the full blown dog and pony show of E3, instead issuing a Nintendo Direct (an online presentation of the new software titles that the company was launching).  In April 2013, we first learned about \"New Super Luigi U\", a full blown game starring Luigi.  To say we were surprised due to \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" had jut launched November 2012 is putting it lightly.However, this isn\\'t the whole story.  \"New Super Luigi U\" straddles the fence between a \"brand new game\" and an extensive \"downloadable content\" addition to an already existing game.  I personally believe we have gotten a retail version of \"NSLU\" for a two fold purpose: this DLC is long enough to merit a stand-alone release, and, much more importantly, acts as a stop-gap release in preparation for the all important Christmas season for the admittedly very slim library of Wii U games that have been available in its first year.While Nintendo has first issued DLC for the 3DS \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" title, this content was largely confined to brief level packs.  With \"New Super Luigi U\", which has been available as a digital download since July, is completely unprecedented in Nintendo\\'s (admittedly very brief) history of DLC: far from being brief level editions, this game is a whole new compaign staring Luigi, perfectly in key for Nintendo\\'s Year of Luigi which is what they have dubbed 2013.For new purchasers, let\\'s define what this game is specifically.WHAT IT IS: A four player game, starring Luigi, two Toads, and Nabbit.  Nabbit is invincible and impervious too any damage and cannot take power ups.  The game features the exact same world map as \"New Super Mario Bros U\"; however, all the levels have been reworked and almost all of them start with only 99 seconds.  Luigi\\'s physics have been reworked, making him floaty in terms of his jumping and very loose, slippy traction.  Due to the time limit, you have to move quickly through the levels.  While four players, the levels here are claustraphobic in nature with more than two players, because of how quickly you must beat them (especially for levels where ground is at a premium). While four player mode has been chaotic in the Wii and Wii U \"New Super Mario Bros.\" games, it is even more frustratingly difficult in \"NSLU\" due to short level times and the deeply increased challenge of the levels in comparison to the other two Mario games.WHAT IT IS NOT: a full-fledged, brand new game staring Luigi..  People are comparing this too \"Super Mario Bros 2: The Lost Levels\" and the original \"Super Mario Bros.\".  This analogy simply does not hold water.  While \"The Lost Levels\" was little more than a mission pack sequel to the original; this title does not feel or play like a true sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", largely due to the brief running times of the levels (99 seconds) and the fact that, although the game has been released as a stand-alone title, this is first and foremost DLC (granted, very expansive DLC, the likes of which we have never seen from Nintendo).  Also, given the identical world map, the game plays simply like a reimagined campaign mode for the first game.  What also should be noted is this game, unlike \"NSMBU\", contains no extra modes and features only the 82 levels of the world map as playable content.Likewise, the price point of this first party Wii U game (29.99 instead of the usual 50-60 dollar range) tells us \"New Super Luigi U\" is not on the same playing field as Nintendo\\'s other first-party titles.  Mario games are famous for keeping their MRSP (or close too it) for years after their initial release, especially Mario titles.  \"Super Mario Galaxy\" and \"The Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess\" did not become noticeably cheaper until the red-cased \"Nintendo Choice\" games of 2011-2013, four to five years after the release of these games.Another thing to be noted is challenge.  The game\\'s difficulty ramps up from the very beginning, and it is clear even in the opening levels that the developers are designing this content for more experienced players. Such unrelenting difficulty (spread throughout the entire duration of the game\\'s playing time) has not been seen since \"Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels\".  Mario, obviously, is Nintendo\\'s bread and butter, and while the Mario games can be challenging, over all they are widely accessible to players of all skill levels.  Such skill level required, consistently maintained at such a high mark throughout the entire duration of the game\\'s worlds, would simply never be considered by Nintendo on a mainstream Mario game, as that would drive away many potential customers and would somewhat hamper the impeccable Mairo brand.Like Greenland as the largest island in the world (but not a continent), \"New Super Luigi U.\" blurs that perhaps hard to define level between new game and simple DLC.  For reasons already outlined, Nintendo has released this has a stand-alone title, but buyers should be aware that this game will not have the same amount of hours as its parent title, due to the intentionally  brief, speed running design of the levels.For those expecting a full-fledged sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros U.\" will find this disappointing to some degree.  For those who go into the game expecting a brief, fun excursion as an extra campaign mode to an already existing title, they will find a lot to enjoy about the game.  Just be aware the game is extremely challenging, and due to that increased challenge, the first \"New Super Mario Bros U\" game will be better if you are looking for four person multiplayer, or, better yet, wait for \"Super Mario 3D World\", which will feature four person multiplayer in a 3D Mario game for the first time ever!',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Now I am going to review a game that most Zelda fans are divided on some hate some like it & that is The Adventure Of Link Zelda II. I am being honest if I want to play Zelda this wouldn't be the 1st game I'd pop in I would go for the 1st game or my favorite A Link To The Past or Ocarina Of Time, Majora's Mask or Twilight Princess which I finally got around to playing I can say each time I play it I like it more & more. Zelda II was released in January of 1987 in Japan & in December of 1988 in The US. So really it was rushed in Japan & btw The Japanese love hard games The Japanese version of Super Mario Brother 2 is very hard so much so that they took another game & put Mario characters in it. I don't know if it would've worked out if they had done the same thing for Zelda II so it's probably best they didn't. Zelda II is unique cause it's a side scroller & it put in more RPG elements. Both the original Zelda on The NES & A Link To The Past on SNES were both overhead games & were more of an adventure game than an RPG. This game doesn't use rupees you have to to rely on experience points & special skills you get in towns when you talk to the old men or knights or the gear or tool you find in towns. So it does have a novelty of being a full RPG & not just RPG elements. There are your typical easy enemies outside in Hyrule & in the 1st few dungeons & the dungeons aren't too bad. The bosses I think are more unique than the original Zelda. I might as well get into the story Ganon was defeated in The Legend Of Zelda but there are still members of Ganon's clan that still worship him & they have what's left of Ganon & the only attempt to bring Ganon back to his pig like glory is they need to kill Link & use his blood to revive Ganon. Link has came back to Hyrule cause he needs to attain The Triforce Of Courage hidden in The Great Palace so evil couldn't get their hands on it. Impa tells Link a story about when The King Of Hyrule died & left the kingdom to Zelda A Wizard tells The King's Son that his sister knows where the 3rd piece of The Triforce is at The Wizard threatens to put a sleeping spell on her. She won't give the location out so she is put under the spell but The Wizard dies right after. So this Zelda has been asleep for hundreds of years. Impa gives Link these 6 gems to place in 6 dungeons to get to The Great Palace. So the remaining followers of Ganon see this as their time to strike & believe me you they are p  i  s  sed at you. You start off with Moblins & bits & bots going after you but then you have these Tektites that are the hardest they have ever been & you have to have the fire spell that shoots fireballs out of your sword to kill them. Not only that you have to deal with these axe wielding enemies called Daria's annoying enemies like Megmat's & these things called Moa's that fly all over the screen. Bago Bago are very annoying & can get in your way & they can knock you off into a pit or whatever & you lose a lifewhich if you lose all 3 lives then it's game over return of Ganon you lose all your experience points I don't know if you lose all your tools or not. I can forgive the difficulty cause a lot of NES games were hard so no problem with it's difficulty but I can't give the 3 lives & you start over the pass.  Another enemy that is bad news is Iron Knuckles the blue Partetamce, The Wizrobe's & even worse in the 3rd dungeon they look like member of TheK  K  K. You have these things called Ra's that fly across the screen they're in the way. The Bubles steal your magic for no good reason & you need magic & you need as much as possible mainly the shield spell, life spell & later on the thunder spell. The attacks you learn like the down thrust come in real handy especially for The Rebonack boss. I will talk about some fo the magic you get the shield spell lets you take less damage when hit. A jump spell that makes you jump higher. Which that spell is also great in boss battles. The life spell does what it says it regains some of your health again great in boss battles. The fairy spell Link turns into a Fairy no comment here. Reflect Spell it knocks back attacks such as The Wizrobes attacks. The spell spell which turns some enemies into bits & bots. The Thunder spell which makes 1 of the last bosses Thunderbird. This game as I said has better bosses than the 1st game well except for the 1st 2 temple the 1st dungeon's boss is Horse Head & in the 2nd temple you have Helmet Head. The 3rd temple you face Rebonack. The 4th temple you face Carock it's rememberable  cause the way you defeat it is using the reflect spell & it doesn't take much to beat it. Gooma in the 5th dungeon is was sort of difficult but not impossible. Volvagia makes it's 1st appearance as Barba in the 6th dungeon it's not as great as the battle in Ocarina Of Time. In The Great Palace you face Thunderbird which you got to learn the pattern to beat it well. Then when you get The Triforce Of Courage you face Dark Link which is an evil version of Link. He's not much of a problem if you know the special method. I fell The Adventure Of Link Zelda II is worthy of being in the franchise. Shigeru Miyamoto must of enjoyed the mental torture this caused back in the day though. This game is all about preference as I said in my Zelda NES review you'll need some patience but not only patience for Zelda II but a lot of coffee & some kind of tobacco product & I won't fault you if you decide to use a Game Genie for this game. This game also established stuff like The Triforce Of Power, Wisdom & Courage. The towns was used more in future Zelda titles. There isn't much more I can say except I will review my favorite Zelda game The Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past next.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': '2011 was a year of exceptionally good games. They easily competed for awards left and right, and Game of the Year was no exception. In my opinion, Skyward Sword is a strong contender for that title. It\\'s a retention and refinement of the same ol\\' Zelda formula, and fans new and old will find much to like here. While the game is rated for everyone, I strongly recommend that players with a great deal of patience should be the sole audience. More skill and dexterity is required to master Link\\'s movements in this legend, so many newcomers or younger gamers may find themselves often frustrated when trying to master the controls. But this isn\\'t to say that the controls are flawed. In fact, while trying eagerly to perfectly fit the Wii\\'s controllers, Skyward Sword shows you just what the Wii is truly capable of--and, at the same time, what it\\'s not capable of.So this is the beginning of the legends. Much is different in this installment, but the game is very much still Zelda. Some may argue it\\'s too formulaic, but consider Ocarina of Time, which actually retained the same formula, translated that formula to 3D, and incorporated the auto-jump and Z-targeting. Skyward Sword keeps the Zelda mantle on, but has so much more detail inside. The motion controls truly change everything--but everyone may not be willing to adapt. Perhaps the only challenge people expect from Zelda titles are dungeons. Sadly, this is no longer the case, but this does not mean that this game is bad; the controls are a new kind of challenge, and, while Nintendo\\'s console\\'s main feature is still relatively new in the gaming world, they still know how to perfect it in its nascent state.As I\\'m sure everyone has been, I was eagerly awaiting 1:1 sword controls, but, unfortunately, became frustrated when I just couldn\\'t get them right. Are we as gamers truly ready for full motion controls? Are they what we really want? Other Zeldas seemed \"easy\" to control; combat was awesome, but never a chore. Now, because we have 1:1 movement, we have to actually be good at controlling Link. My arms did get cramped at times, but I never could get myself to stop playing. If I had work the next day, I still played about 2-3 hours a night, easily. The motion controls did require some configuring every now and then, but, for the most part, controlling wasn\\'t a hassle--much. It becomes an issue only when the sword isn\\'t swinging at the right moment or intended angle, or, when you\\'re flying, when your Loftwing starts flapping uncontrollably for no apparent reason.Continuing with the controls, I initially found them baffling, but they became more intuitive over time, second nature almost. The game itself is the same Zelda we\\'ve all come to know and, for the most part, love. The controls, though, make it a whole new game. As I mentioned before, controlling Link was never really an issue in past Zelda titles. Even with Twilight Princess, people thought that motion controls were to be simple and simplistic. Super Mario Galaxy and 2 pushed the Wii to new levels, but left out the MotionPlus peripheral. There are very few titles out there taking advantage of this gismo as its main interface, games such as Wii Sports Resort and Wii Play Plus, both of which were, in retrospect, teases of Skyward Sword. In this game Link finally follows your movements with the sword to a tee, but strikes in only 8 directions; this restriction, I think, is necessary, as it may be nearly impossible to swing 1:1. To vanquish your foes, you have to rethink your strategy. I\\'ve had more trouble with common baddies than the big baddies, the bosses. I\\'ve become accustomed to running up and swinging wildly, not expecting my enemies to block my attack. Now, the enemies have personality; they have feelings. So, instead of slashing away, I found myself stealthily running up to enemies from behind, which worked far better.If the aim was off, you can swiftly press the down button on the D-pad (where you\\'d normal call for Fi) and it automatically centers. The MotionPlus calibration is necessary only every once in a long while. In the beginning of the game, I used to calibrate quite frequently, until I realized I can just hit down while the Wii remote is also pointed at the center of the TV; it\\'s a quick calibration that works solidly. Contrastingly, one thing I wished that was different about the buttons was A and B. I often confused the two.The dungeons in this game are relatively simple, but just way too long. There are too many rooms consuming the time it takes to complete dungeons. Thankfully, there aren\\'t too many \"dungeons\" in the game. You\\'ll do a lot of back-and-forth progress between Skyloft, but there\\'s a good deal to do there that should keep you interested. Besides the stamina gauge--and, of course, the controls--upgrading gadgets is probably the best addition.I personally don\\'t like the term \"fetch quest\" very much, but do admit that they are plentiful here. Something as simple as giving someone a map is turned into a chore, the task becoming unusually long. Nintendo was trying to fit too much into the game that a lot became cumbersome. With the state of things unnecessary, some of the gear given were pointless, used only for one or two dungeons. There really wasn\\'t any artillery that could make you progress through the game, except for maybe the whip. But there were some good in that: the sub-par weaponry merely built the game up because more than ever I wanted the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, and bow.By the end of the game I found the final boss to be a disappointment. Then again, I had the Hylian Shield by that time, so I\\'m not sure how much of a challenge he would\\'ve proven otherwise. The final cinematic, though, was fantastic. It added a flavor many Zelda fans--including yours truly--have wished for (or at least pondered about) in a title.',\n",

This means, despite briefly playing a few segments from Ocarina of Time and Majora\\'s Mask a few years later, I actually went 17 YEARS without owning or completing another Zelda game!  Is that insane?  Yes!  You\\'re probably wondering... why the long wait?  Sometime in the late 90\\'s I really felt it was time to take an extended break after going strong with a video game obsession (arguably TOO strong) for 10 straight years.  What a long wait, haha.  I just HAD to give in to my temptations and play another Zelda game.  Too many years, too many sequels.  I figure that owning a Wii is pointless unless I have a collection of quality games to play.  Then... I read a couple articles and found out when Skyward Sword was going to be releasd (in November of last year) and the rest is history.  Anyway, after Twilight Princess, it took 5 years for Skyward Sword to be released and the million dollar question is, was it worth the wait?  Simply put, yes.  Probably not a confident or resounding \"YES, it was worth it!\" but just... a yes.  Let\\'s break down several crucial elements of the game.The motion controls.  This is the number one reason many gamers have been divided with mixed feelings.  Some people admire them, others... not so much.  My impression so far is this- the general longtime Zelda fan dislikes the motion controls because they\\'d rather have the traditional way they\\'ve grown accustomed to, wherea non-serious gamers (or those who haven\\'t been following Zelda for 25 years, such as myself) admire the motion controls and believe they\\'re innovative.  I admit, at first I wasn\\'t sold on the controls.  My initial feelings were that the controls were designed to mess with players concerning every single obstacle in the game (which isn\\'t true).  In fact you can say I was downright irritated with the controls.  However as I played through a couple dungeons, I began to realize that swinging the Wii remote around and pretending it\\'s a sword *is* actually a pretty cool idea.  Not only a cool idea, but the right evolution for the Zelda series.  How many generic sword-fighting games have there been on the market over the years?  It\\'s only appropriate that one of the original sword swingers in Link is responsible for such a radically different gameplay change.Not only are these motion controls a \"pretty cool\" idea, now it\\'s going to be difficult for me to go back to *not* swinging the remote around.  The most astonishing thing is that Nintendo made several of the enemies and puzzles so that you HAVE to be precise with your aim and yet it\\'s hardly ever irritating to execute... with a few exceptions that I\\'ll mention below.  If for example, an enemy is holding a sword above their head, this means you can\\'t swing up to down because they\\'ll block it.  You CAN swing down to up however (or swing from the opposite direction, depending how the enemy protects itself).  Precision!  The skeleton mini bosses you encounter later on are notable here.  They frequently alternate the position of their sword used to block/protect their body parts, testing your sword-swinging skills in the process.  If they block one of your swings, simply move out of their way and they won\\'t retaliate.  Alright if you\\'re standing too close to them after they block... they\\'ll probably retaliate THEN (a couple seconds later).  The good news is that moves are almost always blocked in a way that actually allows time on your part to react accordingly, so you never feel like the game is being cheap or overaggressive.  So even if you were to attack an area of an enemy that\\'s protecting itself, they won\\'t respond immediately with a cheapshot.  They\\'ll wait a couple seconds like I mention above.  Nintendo definitely realized how frustrating it would have been if enemies and bosses did attack without delay.  What may SEEM cheap or unfair initially is usually a result of not knowing how to tackle an enemy.  Basically, there\\'s a fairly strong learning curve present that never really lets up, and enemy movements stall to allow the player enough time to figure these movements out for themselves.  Later on however, when you\\'re required to be at a certain skill level, enemies (especially bosses) DO become more violent and aggressive.  Still, nothing overbearing that you can\\'t handle with practice.Some people -actually MOST people- dislike Link\\'s swimming movements.  It\\'s actually not that hard after 30 minutes of practice.  You have to tilt the remote up, down, left or right and Link will swim in that direction.  If you feel he moves too slow, well, luckily the game designers understood how slow underwater movements can be, which is why they added a spin move ability that can temporarily boost speed.  The spin has a few other advantages that you\\'ll discover soon enough (such as being able to leap out of water completely and land on platforms unreachable by simply floating to the surface and trying to climb out).  Now that I\\'m going through the game again, I can swim WAY more accurately this time.  At first my problem was that I couldn\\'t get out of the water and attach to the vines on the wall (that appear in quite a few spots) but now I can\\'t believe I even HAD that problem since my skills have improved so much.  Also, another complaint is your Loftwing- a flying red bird that Link rides on top of and uses as transportation as he travels through the sky.  You\\'ll need a bird ride the entire way through the game.  Just about everyone agrees that the bird moves WAY too slow and since you\\'re riding the bird frequently (at least 100-150 times total) it takes forever just to get from point A to point B.  It\\'s true.  I can\\'t deny it!  However there\\'s ways you can temporarily increase speed with two different types of speed boosts- one of them by hitting the A button and your bird will pick up speed even though the increase is honestly ineffective and barely noticeable, but a much BETTER way is to find these rock structures high in the air that you can fly through.  These REALLY make you fly faster.  You\\'ll know when you see one because it has a clear circle in the middle of it.  Always try to fly through these.Oh and on another note, I initially had NO idea what I was supposed to do at the map screen with the beacons.  I didn\\'t understand the entire concept.  You place beacons on the map to indicate where you want (or need) to go.  Beacons give off a faint blue funnel of light in the sky exactly where you set them on the map.  It\\'s just amazing that you can actually set these beacons at specific points to indicate where your destination is.  To me this is a thing of genius and makes searching for crucial items a LOT easier!  The perfect solution to a HUGE and often times confusing 3D game!  The problem is that the blue light is SO faint, that many times you have to be close to the beacon just to see it.  Perhaps Nintendo was going for realism here with the clouds blowing by and blocking your vision for a a short time, who knows.  I\\'d say *most* of the time you can see the blue light.  Every once in a while though, the dust particles and clouds make it hard to see the beacon light.I STRONGLY disagree with the many complaints I\\'ve read that the characters occupying the land of Skyloft have little to no personality.  Really?  I think they completely smear the townspeople from Link to the Past and I LOVE that classic game so I\\'m by no means criticizing it.  Most everyone at the store in Skyloft (the main area where you\\'ll be spending most of your time and where you buy your items and equipment) are memorable- the depressed/downbeat Item Check woman who totally reminds me of several women that I\\'ve met in real life who are bored to tears by their routine job, the \"boisterous when you\\'re standing across his counter/easily disappointed the moment you walk away\" man who sells shields, bombs, arrows and slingshot bags (and who has a hidden angry side to his demeanor) the huge-eyed fortune teller that gives me the creeps the way his eyes can gaze into your soul, the woman and her husband stirring potion with a screaming baby riding the husbands back, the ADORABLE Kina (wouldn\\'t you like her as a girlfriend?) the sarcastic/ignorant robot named Scrapper you meet later who LOVES to get under your skin and insult Link at every opportunity, and... here\\'s the REALLY interesting part.  You can actually sleep in beds scattered around peoples homes and make it nighttime, which means you can go to the homes of these people, have conversations with them and find out what they\\'re REALLY like.  More often than not, this results in many errands and side quests.I admit when I first explored the town at night, I was totally caught up in the atmosphere of evil cats and blue blobs coming out of the ground, and the scenery feels so much like a beach setting with the wind blowing everything around.  Other times, such as when you visit a place called Lumpy Pumpkin, you can stare into the night sky and feel complete peace like you\\'re in outer space.  It reminds me of the loneliness associated with being alone somewhere far away in the galaxy, or a dream-like state.  It\\'s wonderful.  All criticisms about the game having frequent graphical glitches (I played through the entire game and encountered none- then again I grew up from the NES generation so I\\'ve learned to ignore them) or lackluster townspeople, or the fact that you still have to read several chapters of dialogue as opposed to hearing characters actually speak are all greatly exaggerated.  These supposed complaints are not only tolerable, but forgiveable.  I think Zelda fans set their expectations too high concerning advancements that may or may not have been true, and were simply let down with the final product.  Since I haven\\'t been following the Zelda series all these years, it\\'s very easy for me to overlook these \"faults\".  Then again knowing Nintendo, they probably led people into thinking Skyward Sword *would* have all these features only to end up removing them at the last minute.  I wouldn\\'t be surprised.Speaking of the bosses, I\\'ve heard many complaints that they all have a similar weak point- that being, an eye.  An eye that sometimes takes forever to open up and reveal itself by way of having to attack other areas of the body for an extended period of time, or an eye that is just cleverly hidden and you have to search for it.  Maybe I\\'d complain if it wasn\\'t so much fun slashing at the eye giving the player a feeling of accomplishment when it finally opens up.  Not only that, but finding it and letting loose with sword combos produces an awesome jolt of electricity through my veins!  Now I admit I\\'m actually TERRIBLE at combos in this game (and most games for that matter).  I\\'ve seen the video walkthroughs of gamers and they can blaze through enemy-infested areas by simply swinging the remote a certain way and destroying everything with a few nifty sword combos and make Link appear to be a walking path of destruction, but unfortunately all my attempts at combos leave me swinging the remote like a madman and missing my targets, haha.Let\\'s focus on the dungeons.  Most of them are very good.  As usual, they start off short and fairly easy and gradually get tougher.  At least in this game almost ALL the dungeons have identity and beautiful eye candy backgrounds to admire.  In the first dungeon for example (Skyview Temple) you eventually arrive to the middle part with a really high structure in the middle of the room, and the atmosphere here can best be described as peaceful and dreamy.  It\\'s quite unusual and I absolutely love it.  It doesn\\'t really give off a sense of danger with a boss fight coming up soon, however.  More like a temporary feeling of tranquility, or a brief moment of relaxation.  The dungeons continue with several distinctive designs (especially Ancient Cistern with a perfect blend of water, lily pads, vines and my favorite, the blue rocks in the underground section) until perhaps the final dungeon of the game (called Sky Keep) which is definitely NOT disappointing from a challenge or obstacle-driven point of view, but lacks atmosphere because it simply repeats what\\'s already been done throughout the game.  Not a fan of the final dungeon as a result.  Plus the slide puzzle is... ugh!  You have to operate a slide puzzle that consists of panels and you have to move them a certain way to open the next section of the castle.  It\\'s confusing and truthfully, I had to resort to a guide to figure it out.  There\\'s several possibilities to the puzzle but I couldn\\'t find any of the right ones.The reason I\\'m taking off one point from the overall final rating is... well, 3 reasons. The first reason is Fi.  Fi is a female spirit that FREQUENTLY pops up and tells Link what to do and where to go throughout the *entire* quest.  However her assistance is a little overbearing and unnecessary to say the least.  Now for people like me who struggle at games, I didn\\'t mind Fi nearly as much as those who already know what to do given their quick thinking or video game-minded abilities to easily comprehend obstacles (or the fact they\\'ve been following the Zelda series all along and therefore understand exactly how the obstacles are normally presented).  I can totally see why hardcore Zelda followers would strongly dislike Fi.  The other reason I can\\'t give Skyward Sword a 5-star rating is because the cutscenes are plentiful and sometimes last 10 minutes at a time.  People are not exaggerating when they say it takes at least 90 minutes for the actual gameplay to get underway in the beginning.  This stuff really only serves a purpose for storyline progression (very little of it impactful, in fact) but it\\'s cliched, uninteresting and takes WAY too long to sit through (or stand through, hehe).  Other than a few segments here and there, most of the beginning focuses on your Loftwing (flying bird), how to control him (which is useful information I admit, though actually not descriptive enough so you might get confused with the instructions), competing in a little bird race in the skies, diving off buildings (or rather, being shoved!), LOUSY and cliched interaction between Link and Zelda (and her father) that you\\'ve probably heard in several other fairy tale stories, Fi introducting herself, several townspeople stopping to have a chat with Link, etc.  All this adds up to 90 minutes of unnecessary dialogue scrolling and it *is* overbearing.However the one complaint that people don\\'t seem to have that I most certainly do lies in the dungeons and how they were designed.  They\\'re memorable, don\\'t get me wrong.  They have atmosphere, they have challenge, and they\\'re even extremely fun most of the time.  It\\'s the fact they\\'re always ALWAYS so puzzle-oriented.  It really seems like *every single room* is a new puzzle.  Now my definition of \"puzzle\" is simply \"Something that stands in the way of progression\".  This means having to use your items (and your brain) to make your way forward.  However SO much attention was given to the layout that if you think you can just blow through the game bombing walls, shooting arrows and lighting candles like you did in the 2D games and that will easily solve your problems, you\\'re in for a rude awakening!  Be alert- REALLY alert.  Look at your surroundings VERY carefully and several times over.  It\\'s quite often difficult to figure out which item to use whenever it appears you\\'ve reached a dead end.  Not only a matter of which item, but trickiness in HOW to use them.  Tricky design that\\'s both a blessing (because it\\'s admirable and clever and makes you think \"Ah, THAT\\'S how you access the next room\") and a curse (because it takes away from the adventurous theme Zelda has been known for and sometimes leaves you stumped for hours, and being stuck in one spot quickly makes ANY game less fun).  In relation to the plethora of puzzles are the tasks throughout the game.  I\\'m not necessarily referring to the townspeople and the type of favors they ask out of the player (even though they\\'re the source of most of the tasks) but just the fact the way the game is designed.  \"You do this, now go over there and do that... now come back and do this... now make your way to this island and do THAT!\" etc.  It can be anything from Fi asking you to go somewhere, to searching for and chatting with an important person anywhere across the lands, to... who knows.  Even the dungeons themselves are guilty of needless tasks.  A task-oriented game which ends up distracting the player from simply having *fun*.  You have to REALLY be into the storyline to not care or notice any of these needless distractions, and you have to be willing to forgive Nintendo for making exploration a thing of the past.  Plus you need to be a quick puzzle solver or frustration will kick in sooner rather than later.The items are pretty good though.  You already know about the bow & arrow and bombs- two trademark Zelda items.  Embarrassingly, there was a VERY lengthy learning curve for me in picking up, tossing, rolling and collecting the bombs.  Boy 3D movements can be tricky at times!  For several HOURS I kept hitting the wrong button and blowing myself up, LOL!  To be fair, sometimes the bombs don\\'t toss the way they should.  You\\'re supposed to flick the remote and sometimes the game doesn\\'t know which command you\\'re going for and therefore it gets stuck, which means Link holds onto the bomb and goes boom boom!  When the bomb doesn\\'t flick and is ready to blow, your instinct is to hit a button in frustation... probably the same button that sets the bomb on the ground in front of you and yeah... boom boom, lol.  I look back and laugh now but it wasn\\'t funny while learning!  The slingshot is good but you never need it again after the halfway point of the game so there\\'s no point in upgrading it.  The mechanical beetle is a VERY useful item- you can launch it into the sky and discover new areas and items that are unreachable for Link by himself, or in my case, you can use the beetle to explore all around and get a sneak peek at what\\'s ahead.  The clawshot is awesome- you can grip specific targets but unfortunately you can\\'t use it as a weapon on enemies.  Darn!  Remember peahats?  They were floating enemies from the original Legend of Zelda that could be found in the overworld.  Sort of annoying and pesky in that game, but purposeful here.  Now you can actually use the clawshot to grip onto them to reach higher, distant platforms.  Some peahats even float directly upwards.  VERY creative and useful.Oh and the bug catching net is REALLY realistic given the motion controls.  You have to literally sneak up slowly with the net hanging out so the bugs (or birds) don\\'t suspect that anything is odd with their surroundings, which could startle them and cause them to fly away.  Yeah it\\'s pretty realistic.  You can\\'t just swing the bug net wildly like I was and expect the bugs to willingly fly into your net, lol!  Patience and persistence is needed here.  Still, it\\'s not hard after a while.  There\\'s even an optional bug catching mini game later on that will test your skills.  You can upgrade a bigger net just like you can upgrade most weapons for better results.  Bugs are also used to make stronger potions.  You can actually upgrade potions so they have TWO servings, which means -with 5 bottles- you can fill your life meter a grand total of 10 times!  And hey, you just might NEED 10 servings against the final boss fight too!  Oh boy is he not only intimidating, but VERY tough!  His name is Demise.  How appropriate!The mini games are probably a weak point but it\\'s easy for me to dismiss them.  The clown game at Fun Fun Island STINKS!  You have to use the motion controls to dive through 5 rings without missing a single one *and* land on a specific space below, and that\\'s how you get a piece of heart for your heart container (in case you don\\'t know, 4 heart pieces complete the heart so your life meter extends just like in the older games).  This particular mini game is, simply put, a *nightmare*.  And the clown has the nerve to insult you whenever you lose and sometimes even talks down to you like a crybaby.  UGH!  The mine cart mini game (which isn\\'t a mini game at first- you have to come back later) is another difficult one because you\\'re required to tilt the remote to either pick up speed or slow down at specific points.  You HAVE to do it the right way or you\\'ll either fly off or lose considerable speed!  These are timed races so memorizing the track and being nearly perfect is VERY important.  These are the two most difficult challenges in the game, no doubt about it.  Neither one is a requirement though.  The only required challenging mini game that you HAVE to complete is when your Loftwing is in the process of learning an important attack spin for a boss fight, and you have to destroy 10 targets in 2 minutes in order to be granted the spin move.  Perfect accuracy is a requirement, but memorizing where the targets are makes things a lot easier.Also, you will occasionally come across these huge blocks called Goddess Cubes in the lands below.  Smacking one with a specific upward sword strike activates the treasure chests located on the tiny islands up in the sky that you reach with the Loftwing.  Luckily the map indicates which islands and treasure chests have been activated (with a purple chest symbol) otherwise you\\'d be flying around forever trying to find them!  It\\'s probably a good idea to search for these islands/treasure chests after hitting a few Goddess Cubes so you aren\\'t wandering from island to island *too* many times.  Not that there\\'s consequences if you don\\'t open them as soon as they\\'re available- but the treasure chests up there contain some pretty useful things.  Plus these specific treasure chests seem to follow along with the game so waiting too long to open them might eventually make them irrelevant.  Also, you do NOT need to farm for rupees in this game!  Skyward Sword is very generous with rupees whether it be because you will often find chests and secrets that contain anywhere from 100-300 rupees, or because you can collect numerous items that can be traded at a certain store for up to 1,000 rupees... yeah, very generous.  It\\'s not like the Skyloft store charges outrageous prices for items, potions and upgrades either.In fact, get this- I recommend just *ignoring* green rupees completely.  They\\'re pointless.  Pretend they\\'re not even there!  Go for the blue and red rupees (worth 5 and 20 respectively).  You can even sell some of the collectible items (either found inside chests or from enemy drops) such as the ever popular Amber Relics and the mightiest item of all (Goddess Plumes) to a man downtown who honestly gives you WAY more rupees than he should.  I realize you should be rewarded for collecting them, but each Amber Relic is worth 30 rupees and the Goddess Plume is worth 100.  That\\'s a LOT, trust me!  It really feels like green rupees don\\'t even have a purpose in the game.  Maybe they\\'re becoming meaningless or outdated?  Speaking of pointless things, get THIS!  You don\\'t even need your shield the entire time.  Alright maybe the first battle with the skeleton pirate that goes by the name Scervo requires a shield in order to block some of his sword swipes (in fact you *do* for round 3) but other than that?  You don\\'t need a shield anywhere else in the game.  To me this is *very* shocking.  It just goes to show that the shield is apparently optional in Zelda games.  At least in the 3 games I\\'ve played from beginning to end.  Not even anytime during the final dungeon or the boss fights at the end of the game.  Update- it turns out in Hero Mode you DO need a shield for Demise because he takes away 4 hearts from a certain dangerous charge attack, and you will need to block that.  Also, since I brought up Hero Mode, it\\'s supposed to be an additional challenge after you complete the regular game since no hearts are present anywhere (until you find the Heart Medal that is) so I recommend having a healthy collection of Blessed Butterflys, Woodland Beetles, Volcanic Ladybugs, Sand Cicadas, Eldin Rollers and Deku Hornets before taking on Demise at the end of the original (first) adventure so all challenges in the beginning of Hero Mode are easier to deal with.As you\\'ve probably read about, there\\'s only 3 areas that you can explore.  The green grassy lands of Faron Woods, the lava-covered volcano world of Eldin Volcano, and the desert and secluded areas of Lanyru Desert.  However it\\'s important to note that there\\'s *several* areas to these 3 worlds.  They\\'re most definitely not short.  You can\\'t blaze through them.  Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano and Lanyru Desert open and reveal more as the game goes on.  Yes you will be repeating over the areas you already explored more often than not in order to GET to the new areas, but since there\\'s always something new to discover, it\\'s really not a chore.  Oh... the stamina meter.  That DARN thing!  Link can run for a certain (limited) period of time.  If you make Link run for too long, he\\'ll run out of steam (as evident by an irritating beeping sound).  However it\\'s important to stop running RIGHT before the meter runs out *completely* otherwise Link will tire out and stagger around for a few seconds until he returns to normal.  You do NOT want to find yourself out of breath when surrounded by enemies and with a few hearts remaining, so keep an eye on that meter.  Yes I hate it too.  It will *constantly* be annoying as you eagerly want to run nonstop across a lengthy hallway only to be forced to slow down and stop thanks to the stamina meter running low.  Also maybe it\\'s just me, but the temporary stamina boosts you occasionally stumble across (especially in Skyloft) always seem to be sitting in inconvenient places where I\\'m required to veer to the side to grab them, and oh, if this happens to be your first 3D Zelda game, expect to miss items constantly.  Since it\\'s 3D, there\\'s a tendency to run circles around an item a few times before actually picking it up.  It\\'s fairly annoying but you can\\'t really help it- being off a bit and finding yourself in a situation where you\\'re missing items is just the nature of 3D gaming.  Not a major problem of course, and you\\'ll adjust with practice and time.As far as enemies, well truth be told several areas of the land are empty in that regard.  Even fairly large portions in a few cases.  Not really unacceptable since there\\'s usually atmosphere and beautiful graphics serving as a replacement.  Both the overworld and dungeons feature significantly less enemies than say, the older 2D Zelda games.  The only enemy encountered frequently (besides bats and bokoblins which can be dismissed as being non-threatening) also happens to be the most irritating of the bunch- these blobs (called chuchus) that suddenly come out of the ground as you\\'re walking or running by.  They always happen to pop out of the ground RIGHT when you\\'re a few steps in front of them and catching you completely by surprise, which means you\\'ll be shaking the nunchuk/remote constantly to shove them off (because they love to squeeze Link\\'s body!).  The ones that give off an electrical charge are the worst- your immediate instinct after being attacked is to swing your sword and retaliate however... the game desigers were apparently aware of this which means the moment you shake one away, they will electrify RIGHT as you\\'re swinging the sword which means you\\'ll get shocked and lose another heart.  Yes, VERY annoying.  Another popular enemy is called deku baba which are the blue and yellow plants that are mostly found in the grassy parts or the hilltops.  They take full advantage of the motion controls.  In fact they\\'re one of the very first enemies you run into.  It\\'s actually sort of important to perfect your swings against these guys- when they open their mouths a certain way, you have to swing the remote in that direction and trust me, you have to be accurate or they\\'ll quickly close their mouths and block the shot.  I recommend practicing on these guys for a while and getting comfortable with their movements because they indicate more demanding sword swinging precision up ahead.I could nag about a few minor things such as the fact you have to repeat a boss battle with an enemy that goes by the name the Imprisoned up to 3 times, but those battles are short and there\\'s a trick in making them MUCH easier (hint, whirlwinds).  Oh, and the harp can be a pain to play in a few isolated places (such as the lady in Sealed Grounds who teaches Link how to play it- she\\'s very demanding and expects perfection out of the player) but the good news is that nobody else in the game expects perfection when it\\'s time to play the harp again.  Basically you play the harp like this- hold down the A button, and wave the remote back and forth with the rhythm of the music.  It\\'s not quite as easy as it sounds, and for whatever reason the notes frequently get jumbled, but how the notes are organized doesn\\'t seem to matter at all- simply waving the remote correctly is where it counts.  I also DESPISE walking across tightropes.  Even worse some tightropes have bombs attached to the side or underneath the rope itself, which means when you\\'re cautiously walking across and one explodes, you\\'ll fall and have to climb back up and attempt to walk across again.  The problem is that walking across tightropes is easier said than done- you have to *really* tilt the remote from left to right (or right to left depending which side Link is leaning) in order to stay balanced.  The good news is that when you fall, Link will hold onto the rope with his hands and you can climb across by hanging (with the exception of bomb explosions that immediately knock Link off) or just hit Up on the analog stick to continue walking across the rope.  And when you fall off a rope or platform, you don\\'t actually lose any hearts (unless it\\'s REALLY high).  Oh and whenever you fall into a bottomless pit, the game is normally generous enough to bring you back close to where you fell.  Sometimes they\\'re *too* generous and take you to where you need to be, lol.Oh wait, I just remembered!  BIG complaint coming!  The boat rides.  They are flat out boring and undeveloped.  The boat is only there so you can reach your next destination island and in one example, used to locate a ghost ship and fire cannonballs at it.  The developers *definitely* should have added more here.  These boat rides are only a few minutes long and the surrounding enemies are never really a threat, if at all.  Why bother throwing in a boat segment to the game if it feels incomplete?  Oh well, the boat rides are only 3-5 minutes total and it\\'s over and done with, but still, more excitement should have occurred because the way it is, it feels like it\\'s missing something.  I don\\'t know, maybe the ability to go fishing or collect items on top of the water as you drive by or better yet, compete in a mini game or speed race where you can perfect your skills dodging several of the tiny islands in the middle of the water.  *Something* more should have been added.  Simply picking up speed and slowing down your boat isn\\'t interesting enough.Let\\'s see, what else can I mention.  You start the game with 6 hearts instead of 3 and I imagine the reason is that Nintendo figured people would struggle with the motion controls so they chose to give the player 6 hearts right out of the gate.  Hey I\\'m not complaining- there were several times when I *needed* those extra hearts!  The heart container pieces are sometimes cleverly hidden but more often than not, it\\'s obvious where they are.  Hey, Link to the Past was guilty of obvious to spot heart pieces as well but that game\\'s still -and forever will be- awesome to the max.  You can collect these items called gratitute crystals for helping people around town with chores and errands.  Some of these crystals can even be found scattered around town (only at night though).  80 might seem like a lot, but there\\'s several instances where you get 5 at a time, so 80 isn\\'t really much.  The ones you find around town are worth 1, but the chores and errands are worth 5.  Gratitude crystals are simply a way to expand the story and further develop the characters, and nothing more.  Innocent fun basically.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'My history with Zelda dates all the way back to Link\\'s Awakening on the original Game Boy.  Few franchises have enraptured me and have delivered such consistently high quality titles as the Legend of Zelda series has.  These games have a reputation for just oozing quality and a sense of adventure.  Majora\\'s Mask and Wind Waker still rank among my top 10 games of all time.  Recently, however, I\\'ve seen a bit of decline in quality in the series.  Twilight Princess, while still a very good title, had a tendency to feel \"dull\" and drag out at times.  Phantom Hourglass on the DS was even worse, removing direct control of Link from the player in favor a clunkier touchscreen approach, and forcing the player to replay the same terrible dungeon half a dozen times during the game.  Spirit Tracks fixed a few of the issues introduced in Phantom Hourglass, but still had its share of problems.So enough about the history, what do I think about Skyward Sword?  Well, after spending about 40 hours completing the main adventure and trying to find every collectible scattered about the world, I can say that although I was rather disappointed with certain aspects of the game, the Zelda spark is still alive and kicking.  Let\\'s take a look at what I like and don\\'t like about the game.  I will try to keep my review as spoiler-free as possible, although I will need to reference a few different game mechanics (but I\\'ll be as vague as I can).The GoodThe Story - Longtime fans of the Zelda series will find a lot to enjoy about this game\\'s story.  As you have probably heard, Skyward Sword has been established as the very first game in the chronology of the Legend of Zelda series.  There are a lot of answers here regarding the origins of Hyrule, the Master Sword, Ganondorf, Link, and Zelda.  Although I\\'d say that this game draws more parallels to Twilight Princess than any other game, there is still much for fans of the other games (particularly Ocarina of Time) to find as well.The Graphics - In a stark contrast to Twilight Princess\\'s dark, washed-out world, Skyward Sword is full of bright, vibrant colors that spark memories of Wind Waker.  The characters are much more realistically proportioned than Wind Waker\\'s characters, while still maintaining a great deal of expression.  The game retains the enormous draw distance of its predecessors, and accomplishes this by fading distant objects to have a watercolor-like look to them.  The result is a game that looks extremely pretty and art-like.  However, the Wii\\'s underpowered hardware is certainly starting to show its age here.  Some models have a tendency to look jagged, and 480p can only convey so much detail.  The game is doing the best with what it\\'s been given, but unfortunately, that might not be enough anymore.  Nintendo knows this, and I think that\\'s why they\\'re rushing to get the Wii U out to market while Microsoft and Sony are sticking with the consoles that they have for now.  It would be smart of Nintendo to seize the opportunity and come out with Skyward Sword HD as a launch title for Wii U.The Sound - Once again, Koji Kondo and company manage to create an entralling, memorable soundtrack for Skyward Sword.  There are a number of memorable songs that you\\'ll be hearing throughout your adventure.  For a mind-blowing experience, listen to Ballad of the Goddess backwards (look it up on YouTube). Sound effects are also excellent, giving you a real sense of immersion into your environment.Dungeon Design - Dungeons have always been a hallmark of the LoZ series, and Skyward Sword is no exception.  While a couple are forgettable, dungeons 4, 5, and 7 are some of the most innovative and mind-blowing ones to date.The BadThe Story - I already explained everything that I like about the story, but there\\'s one major thing I didn\\'t like about the story:  There\\'s very little motivation.  I don\\'t want to go into too much more detail, but I will say that, for the most part, your world doesn\\'t really feel all that threatened.  In Ocarina of Time, you saw the devastation that Ganondorf unleashed on Hyrule over 7 years.  In Majora\\'s Mask, you saw the moon literally falling out of the sky.  In Wind Waker, you met your nemesis early on, and he made this fight personal.  In Twilight Princess, you saw your world being consumed by another realm.  In Skyward Sword, you don\\'t have that same motivation or sense of urgency.  Most of the dungeons and challenges revolve around \"proving yourself\" rather than defeating bad guys.  You should be on a quest to save the world, not on a quest to show how brave you are.World Design - Skyward Sword contains my least favorite version of Hyrule to date.  In every other Zelda I\\'ve played, the world is a single, cohesive unit, where you are able to start off in one location and traverse the entire world by foot/horse/boat.  Not so in Skyward Sword.  There are 4 major areas in the game: The Sky, and 3 provinces on the ground.  The provinces are completely cut off from one another, the only way to travel from one to the other is via The Sky.  This breaks the epic, sprawling feel of the world that the LoZ series is known for.  And with the lack of a decent warp system, it makes travel extremely tedious.Inventory Management - The Wii version of Twilight Princess made some excellent advances toward inventory management by adding a radial menu that allowed you to quickly select and assign items to different inventory slots.  While Skyward Sword retained the whole \"radial menu\" concept, they took the \"inventory slots\" idea and tossed it out of the window.  You now retain two separate types of inventory: A standard inventory for your main tools, such as your slingshot, your bow, and your bombs, and an \"adventure pouch\" which stores shields, bottles, and medals (a new concept to the game, basically trinkets which bestow various effects on you).  You get exactly 1 inventory slot for each pouch.  This means that if you need to use your bow to shoot an enemy and then you want to toss a bomb at it, you need to open your inventory, select the bow, shoot the bad guy, open the inventory again, select your bombs, and then use the bombs.  This is, quite frankly, a stupid design choice, and one that I hope Nintendo never makes again.  And it\\'s not for lack of button options either, the left and right buttons on the D-Pad remain unused for the entire game.The UglyControls - If there was still any debate as to whether motion controls could ever work for serious gaming, let Skyward Sword put that debate to rest.  The controls are, quite frankly, terrible.  The game uses MotionPlus rather than the sensor bar to figure out where you\\'re trying to aim, and the results are often unreliable.  In fact, they\\'re so bad that they had to create a dedicated button to re-center your cursor.  And trust me, you\\'ll be pressing it often.  Sword swings rarely give you that true 1:1 feeling that you\\'re expecting, with Link often swinging the sword in the completely opposite direction, cause you to miss your enemy or take unexpected damage.  For a game that focuses so much on precision swordplay, that\\'s completely unacceptable.Repetitiveness - As I mentioned before, there are only 4 major areas in the game.  And you\\'ll be revisiting them like crazy.  Expect to visit each major area of the game at least 5 times before you finish the game.  There are also a couple of repetitive boss encounters.  There are two recurring boss fights, each of which you will face 3 times (with slight variations).  Neither of these boss fights is very fun at any point.  There is also another end of dungeon boss which is repeated once again later in the game.  Repetitive boss fights aren\\'t fun, they\\'re just a sign of laziness and a lack of creativity.Annoyances - Skyward Sword is a game that seems to be intentionally designed to annoy the player as much as possible.  Your companion, Fi, is obnoxious, interrupting you constantly by stating the obvious.  When it comes to actually needing her help with something, the information that she provides is usually completely useless.  Another annoyance deals with collecting treasures and bugs.  These collectibles are used to upgrade your equipment and potions, respectively.  But every time you pick up a type of treasure or bug for the first time during that particular play session, you get a popup explaining what you just collected (even if you already have 50 or 100 of them), and the game opens up your treasure screen to show everything you\\'ve collected so far.  The whole process takes about 10 seconds, and there\\'s no way to disable it.  Eventually you\\'ll just give up on collecting these things, because the hassle simply isn\\'t worth it.  Yet another annoyance is the number of \"stealth missions\" that the game forces you to do.  These aren\\'t fun, they\\'re simply annoying, especially when you get close to completing one, get caught, and have to do the whole mission all over again.Game Length Padding - There\\'s a lot of this in the game.  Much comes from what I just mentioned, but there\\'s a few other examples of this.  You\\'ll often be sent to other provinces to retrieve objects.  Due to the clunky travel system, this is a chore in and of itself.  However, there\\'s one point in the game where you\\'re supposed to bring something to the top of a mountain.  Normally you can dive out of the sky and just land on top of the mountain.  But for a completely meaningless reason, during this quest you have to start at the bottom of the mountain (that you\\'ve already climbed several times before), and escort an NPC all the way to the top before he takes too much damage from enemies.  Stuff like that wants to make me throw the game out of the window.  There was absolutely no point to it, and it made the game worse as a result.  As I mentioned before, I spent about 40 hours playing this game, but they could have easily had 25 hours of content by stripping out all of the annoying stuff and this would have been a much better game as a result.  In the case of Skyward Sword, less is definitely more.So I\\'ve spoken my peace about this game.  There\\'s a lot about it that I hate.  So why 4 stars?  Because despite all of these glaring issues, this is still a gem of a game, and deserves to be played by everybody.  While I was somewhat disappointed in it as far as Zelda games go, as far as video games go, it\\'s very good.  Far from perfect, but definitely good.  If you own a Wii, you\\'d be remiss not to pick this one up.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Link's Crossbow Training is a pack-in with the Wii Zapper, but you don't really need that Zapper to play this game. I picked this up without the Zapper for four dollars at a local game shop, and I'm pleasantly surprised by its quality.The object of the game in Link's Crossbow Training is to shoot a variety of targets, and occasionally enemies from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (from which this title gets its locations, music, and graphics). Sometimes the game plays on rails, while at other times you move around with the nunchuk as if you were playing a normal Zelda game. I would add that the use of TP's graphics results in one of the finer looking rail shooters that I've played (and I rather like these sorts of games.).There are 27 stages over the course of 9 levels, but an average Wiimote user should be able to blast through the entire game quickly. The real challenge and staying power of of Link's Crossbow Training comes from attempting to achieve its platinum medals, which you get for scoring in excess of 80,000 points on a given set of 3 stages. I've gotten three so far, and will probably have a few more if I opt to sit down with it a little more. But a couple of those Levels (the ones with bosses, in particular) look like they'd be very hard to get that kind of score on. So there's a real challenge in this game for points players.It was a very good game for four dollars, but even with the 'quest for the platinum medals', Link's Crossbow Training comes across as a pretty minimalist shooter. There's a multiplayer, but from what I understand, you can't play two players simultaneously... mostly due to the piece of plastic Nintendo sold it with. And outside of hunting down those medals, Link doesn't have a whole lot to do.You should check it out if you can find it for as little as I did. It's better than a lot of 20 or even 30 dollar games I've bought.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Legend of Zelda as a series has a lot of wonderful titles in it's history. This is a good one, but I don't feel it holds up to what it could have been. In memory, my most recent comparison would be Twilight Princess, but I also enjoyed Windwaker before that. Now, before you instantly hate on me for not absolutely loving this game (which happened in my review of Ocarina 3DS), please understand that I'm a fan too and I just don't think this one hold up as well as it could have.Here's what I didn't like about the game:The sword control was neat, but nothing that couldn't have happened in a dual analog stick setup. In the end, you still only had 4 swinging axis. I do think that this control scheme was more enjoyable than that and incredibly awesome. But I also think it doesn't make up for the games other problems. I liked the stamina gauge, but when running, if you get near a wall, you may accidentally run up it. You could also run up ladders and vine walls, but you have to be spot on otherwise you do yet another wall run. This would have been fine 5 years ago, but it felt weird to have the detection problem today. I found the control scheme to be a bit awkward and even at the end of the game sometimes I accidentally hit the wrong or wrong series of buttons. The maps felt a bit off, feeling a bit more like Metroid than Zelda. I should have liked it, but often I didn't really warmed up to an area like I did with previous Zelda titles.  I also felt while there were enough dungeons in the game, the overworld map didn't have a lot of variety. During playing Twilight Princess, I thought to myself 'this is the last time they can get away without having voice acting'. Sadly, they still went without it this time, but it's even more awkward because I feel this Zelda actually does a good job and really has a lot more interesting a identifiable characters. I want to either hear their voice or maybe have the whole game pantomime (which would be equally awesome, if not more awesome). But hearing the strange grunts followed by long lines of dialog just killed the mood for me more often than not, especially with such otherwise vibrant characters. I know voice acting is a bit split topic among Zelda fans though, but IGN did a poll and well over 50% of fans would rather hear voice acting in Zelda (though I still wouldn't want Link to speak. He's a regular Gordon Freeman). One thing that I'm sure will get me negative comments is I just didn't care for the graphics. I thought the character graphics were awesome and the design incredible and very well stylized. But the background rendering and stylization just looked ugly to me. I found somewhere online that said it was supposed to look painted, but it just looked like bad youtube video at times. Ghirahim is an annoying villain that I just didn't care for. Theatrically flamboyant does not a villain make and he had little else as a character.The good:The boss battles were amazing. They were so fun that I can easily see wanting to go back and play them again. I thought the dungeon puzzles were often really awesome and felt more integrated into the game than previous installments. I felt like the difficulty was usually well balanced throughout the game, with only a few exceptions. I liked that they tried something different, even if I didn't care for the map layout and overworld feel, I like that it was something new. I know this looks short, but I also mentioned aspects of things I thought were good in the above 'bad' list, so it isn't that short.The overall feeling:When I first started playing this game, I felt like I was popping in something from 5 years ago that I missed and didn't get a chance to play when it came out. With Nintendo's own Mario Galaxy they've shown what great gameplay and visuals can be on the Wii, and I just don't feel Skyward Sword lives up to what could have been, but it's still quite good. If you're on the fence about it, just ask yourself if you wouldn't mind playing a 5 year old game with a really cool gameplay mechanic and control scheme. It has a gameplay time of around 50-60 hours, which felt a little long, but I still mostly enjoyed it.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I'll have to admit, I'm not too far into this game yet, but I'm just sooo overly enthused about it, I just had to let it out. Generally, I'm very anhedonic and difficult to please. Most things that others are overjoyed by only mildly spur me.Was this game worth the five year wait? At present, I know not, but I will say this much: I can't seem to stop playing it. This game seems so much more logical to me than the previous Zelda games. For example, there is actually a better purpose for collecting bugs and treasures than to just get some silly reward for them. In previous Zelda games, when one obtained treasure, what was it used for? Almost Nothing! You just got it to sell it. And what for? For pointless Rupees that usually had no function in the game. What about the fishing feature from Twilight Princess? What on earth was that all about!!? HERE, on the other hand, the pointless acquisition of game or items is more limited; here, you need to collect items to be put to use to make or upgrade potions and items. And many of the items are not so easy to collect. The monster claws are difficult to find. The Blue Bird Feathers even more so. And the items you obtain here are much more purposeful than for simple aesthetics (does fishing in TW come to mind?). In a nutshell, this is the closest thing I've ever seen yet to a perfect system of capitalism from a Zelda game so far: You want a reward or credit something, ya gotta work for it! Plain and simple.As for the bird controls, I don't have an issue with them. Anyone ever played Super Mario 64 recently? Well, I have, and let me tell ya controlling the bird in this game is a piece of cake compared to controlling the flying Mario in Super Mario 64, so don't nobody give me no more waves about that one anymore, y'hear?Suffice it to say, so far I am very pleased with this one. Just hope we don't have to wait another 5 years for the next one. And while I will agree that Skyloft is a bit small and could have been bigger, this minor oversight does not detract from my enjoyment of the experience and the full feeling of captivation I get by immersing myself in the fantasy this game presents. I can't wait to see how it turns out!Oh, and on a sidenote. Want some advice on how to make this game even more enjoyable? Try using a dirty word to name your character. That way, on top of an experience of great fantasy and adventure, you'll also be busting your gut anytime a dialogue sequence occurs. Try it out! It's just sooo funny! I do it almost every time I play a game that allows you to name the character. It's a blast!I'll update this review accordingly if there are any new insights that need to be added upon my eventual progression through the game. For now, I bid everyone adieu.UPDATE: 12/08/2012Well Here I am again. I've finally managed to find time to write this follow-up review to the one above, which only documents my reactions to the game upon just starting it. Although I actually finished this game a few months ago, it took me a while to find a free moment to write this due to being extremely busy. Now I'd like to offer some perspectives/criticisms from the POV of having completed it once.The most interesting thing of note about this most recent release of Zelda is the nice array of innovations that it offers, such as:1) Wow! Isn't it just fascinating to actually play a Zelda game where the Link character is actually able to run/dash in order to move faster, instead of just rolling on the ground repeatedly like some moron who's lost his mind? I think so, but it would have been nice if the stamina meter lasted a bit longer. It expires way too fast!2)Wow! A Zelda game where Link is actually able to swim instead of just diving straight down like in the previous titles! Good idea! And I must give my praise to the designers who thought of that stage where the forest gets flooded and the Link character must swim around looking to collect musical notes! Wonderfully captivating!! My only beef is that there just wasn't enough of that; and, like above, the stamina meter is far too low, and the enhancement potions do little to improve things.3) The idea of needing to activate Goddess Cubes on the surface world in order to render chests in the skyworld openable is awesome. But it's equally sad that many of the items those chests yield are junk items, such as the extra quiver! I mean, what archer, in even the cheesiest fairly tale carries more than one quiver? Moreover, not only is there barely any room in our pouch for an extra quiver, but even if there were, we still wouldn't have a need for it! ONE QUIVER, upgraded to the max, gives the player more than enough arrows to use (especially since they always can be found in the various plants/bushes). Also be advised, Nintendo Game Makers: ONE HEART MEDDLE DOES THE JOB JUST FINE! We do not need an one of those either!4) Speaking of innovations, in my above review, I complemented this game in its use of capitalism, or to put it more precisely, I complemented the feature it has of making the player collect treasures/ingredients to upgrade weapons, items, etc. (an idea probably burrowed from games like Spirit Tracks and such). While it's a nice idea, in theory, as I kept moving forward in the game, I discovered flaws in this game's execution of the idea. Many of the more difficult to obtain treasures are barely used! The blue bird feathers, mentioned above, for example aren't needed much. In fact, you only need about 4 or 5 total in the whole game! The same goes for the evil crystals! And sometimes these rarer ones can be obtained in random treasure chests! Thus, the fun of hunting the treasures to make item upgrades is greatly reduced!Then there are other treasures, such as the Amber Relic, which are scattered everywhere! And I have no idea why! What are we supposed to do with all of these Amber Relics? By the end of the game, I have about 40 to 50 of these items and have zero use for them!5) One thing I can really complement this game on is the idea of the Beetle! This item is like a boomerang controlled by remote. I love how you can use it to scout certain areas and also retrieve items that are otherwise, unobtainable or difficult to get! And I loved the way they can pick up bombs and hurl them at enemies. Nice feature! Hope to see it again!6) Another thing I really enjoyed was the Gratitude Crystal side quests! These quests were obviously inspired by the Gold Skulltula quests from Ocarina of Time, where you have to have to collect a bunch of tokens (and in this case crystals) to free someone from a curse.While in OOT, all you did was just run around looking for them, in Skyward Sword, there's more to it--you need to perform certain chores or tasks to get most of them (except for 15 of them, which can only be collected at night).In theory this was a fun idea (especially in a world like Skyloft), and I enjoyed the side-quests very much as they allowed me to experience Skyloft in better detail; but in the end I experienced disappointment, as all I received for my trouble was a Super Giant Wallet, which is totally useless in the game!!! Though I may admit that this Zelda title does make better use of Rupees than previous ones do, there is still never a time in the game when you will ever come close to needing 9,000 of them! A BETTER FINAL REWARD WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ORDER! And it would also be nice if in future Zelda games: THESE SIDE-QUESTS COULD HAVE A DEEPER INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MAIN QUEST!7) And while I liked the idea of making Link sleep in a bed to be able to go around at night, next time, please have more for him to do at night! There is barely any use for nighttime in this game!! (I also hope they change the position he sleeps in. It hurt me just looking at him getting into that bed!)*****************************************And that just about wraps it up! Those are my main criticisms of the game. I have a few other mild ones, such as that the skydiving also wasn't more involved with the main quest and mostly functioned to get Link from area to area. Some of the minigames were too protracted to even bother with, such as the Thunder Dragon's Lightening Round (which appeared to offer little reward for the trouble). That minigame with Fledge, I all but gave up on! Because the control kept going off alignment (motion control still has a few kinks).Overall, I mostly did enjoy this game and loved many of its innovations. A few extra ones to note (aside from the ones already mentioned) are: the Imprisoned, the stage where Link is captured and deprived of weaponry was really cool, and its mild use of the time travel element. I especially was impressed with those Silent Realm challenges! That was something I've never seen before! And what about the Reformed Bully idea? Top notch! I hope that character, Groose, appears again in a future title. (Oh! and let's not forget the adjustable dungeon!) The overall idea of a Sky world itself has great possibilities and should be explored further...My opinion on most games varies little from when I start them to when I finish them. For example, in my review of Super Mario Galaxy 2, I made some mild inaccurate observations, due to my lack of progress in the game; however, my opinion upon completing it, stayed more or less the same. With this game, my opinion changed slightly and I lowered the star-rating to a 4 instead of a 5, due to the above-stated problems and others (though I left the fun-rating alone).Now that I've played through this game once, would I be motivated to try it in Hero Mode? Probably not anytime soon! Because although this was a reasonably good game, I found it to have some holes in its construction, or to put it more clearly, it played like a game that was put together from an incomplete blueprint, and thus lacking a completely fluid storyline! (And one of the bosses, Ghirahim, who makes several appearances, I never could figure out how I actually defeated him the first couple times, and I fear that in Hero Mode, I would have severe trouble dealing with him anyway.Future Zelda games, if they take 5 years to make, should come off like they really took 5 years to make! This one really seemed like a 2 year job! Also, I hope that for future Zelda games, they can hire better musical composers. Most of the music in this game stinks (though the music in Bug Heaven was actually pretty good) and pales in comparison to the music in Ocarina of Time!! And while I thought the Fairy in this game was interesting, in the future I hope she's given a bit more charm and has more involvement with the quest. And make Skyloft bigger next time! (Though I hope that's something the gamemakers don't need to be told, in addition to finally including real voice-acting!) Also, if you're going to include a whip in the game, put it to better use!Do I hope that this game is sequalized? Most certainly! And my best advise for the sequel game would be that it should be more concrete and not come off like one of those true/false statements where most of the statement is true, but some small parts of it are false making the whole statement false, like this game comes off.Anyway, that's my final assessment of Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. I took a lot of trouble and time to finally put it down. And while it may not be read by many, I hope at least that a few concerned persons might peer at it and take some tips from it (however sloppily it may be written) and put its suggestions to good use for future Zelda titles. And, more importantly, that it does not entirely fall on deaf ears! For it would truly be a shame to release a sequel to this game for the Wii U (and who knows how many years that'll take?)and have it suffer from the same flaws that this one does!\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Dislcaimer: I have given this game a 4/5 star rating, however on a different scale I would probably have given it a 9.5. Very minor spoilers included, none of them story related.In many ways, this is the best Zelda game ever. It stays true to what it has always been about, while at the same time introducing new gameplay elements, and has a different, unique feel to it.The core experience of the game is breathtakingly good and anyone who has a soft spot for Zelda will in all likelihood thoroughly enjoy this game.While a passing glance it may seem like this is just a traditional, run of the mill Game; Go get three of these things, a few more of some of those things now, kill the final boss and call it day. Those things are all still true but there have been many changes made to make it feel fresh and exciting.Most obviously, the \"hub world\", your home town, is a floating island in the sky, and instead of traversing to different areas on foot, or via horseback, you have your very own bird to explore around with.Before I played the game I figured that this mechanic would play out similarily to the boat/ocean gameplay of Wind Waker,however that is not really the case. You have your main Hub, and then there are 3 large areas on the ground that you can visit (they are not interconnected and you will have to return to the sky to switch between them) this takes about 2-3 minutes tops per trip, a far cry from the 20 minute boat rides in the aforementioned wind waker. While nothing about the flying is particularly bad, there is nothing that fun about it either, and If the game took place entirely on the ground it wouldn\\'t have bothered me any.There is also a dash button, which is really well implemented.The dungeons(or temples, whatever) are back, but with a new twist. Each one has what I like to refer to as a pre-dungeon area.These areas, are in essence, the overworld.That being said, these are nothing like the overworlds of past games.If the dungeons were to be considered the \"levels\" of a Zelda game, then these pre dungeon areas would be levels too in their own right. They must be completed in order to gain acsess to the dungeons themselves.Most of them revolve around collecting some things, but their is enough variety in the design of the areas that it didn\\'t bother me. They aren\\'t as fun as the dungeons themselves, but they are great fun for the most part, and are quite original.As for the dungeons, Nintendo really outdid themselves. These are easily the best ones I\\'ve played since Ocarina Of Time.They threw out what didn\\'t work, kept what did, and added in some great new stuff.For starters, you get the dungeon map (no more compass, it\\'s built into the map now) as well as the dungeon item, fairly early on. Gone is the endless parade of small keys, most dungeons only containing one or two.They are just plain well designed, rarely did I feel confused enough to have to look at the map.The puzzles are clever and original,and the boss battles are easily the best this series has ever seen,and are the one element of the game that really take advantage of the motion controls. I also think it is worth nothing that each dungeon is a little bit bigger in scope and scale, so the game gradually gains a real epic feel, slowly building up steam. It was a nice touch that I really apprecieated.Remember those hideously ugly kids from Twilight Princess?Thankfully nothing even half as ugly shows up in this game. All the characters are appealling, both in their physical appearance, and in their personalitys.There are some real genuinely funny bits too. I was really impressed with how well some new characters were intergrated so deeply into the story.As for the story, it is the same old Zelda fare, but it has alot more heart to it. You actually understand and respect the characters motivations for doing what they do, which in turn makes the game more fun.The dialog is much improved from past entires, but the same grunts and groans are still audible. I don\\'t particularly care one way or the other if there is voice acting, but it is becoming increasingly bizarre in these games that Link doesn\\'t talk. Most of the time there will be a short pause or a small cutscene to indicate that Link did in fact say something, but we\\'re better of using our imaginations. Fine, that\\'s acceptable. But what truly annoys me is how that contrasts with other instances where he flat out doesn\\'t tell someone something(you can tell by the context of what their response) and it just makes absolutely no sense.Music is good, but not great. Some tunes were quite catchy and had the perfect feel for the level they were in, others just felt kind of bland.The graphics will likely be a point of contention for many gamers, and I admit that I was initially appalled by them, however I was won over by the incredible art style and what I like to refer to as tonal harmonies; the different colors used perfectly compliment each other and are very appealing to look at.No, this isn\\'t as good looking as a great ps3/360 game, and it would be insanity to pretend that it is, but it is what it is.At the end of the day, this is one hell of a game,a game that has breathed new life into a series that felt stagnant and out of date, and filled it with life again. Unfortunately there are some aspects to the game that are so utterly frustrating and outrageously stupid that I have to wonder what the hell was Nintendo thinking?To start with, the controls. I\\'ll admit my own personal bias probably factors into this somewhat. I don\\'t like motion controls. I\\'m a lazy son of a yam fry and I would much rather just lay back and press some buttons.This game you must necessarily be sitting up, or standing while playing.But my own sluggish nature aside, I really think the controls could have been much much better on a traditional controller. The sword combat with the wii motion plus,(which is needed to play the game) and probably the games main gimmick, just falls flat.It works well enough, swinging your controller in a particular direction to make link do likewise with his sword, but the problem is how you use it on enemies. Usually the key to defeating them lies not in any specific directional attack, but is mere timing, so what the hell is the point? The only time where I really had any fun with it was during a few of the boss battles. I admit that using the remote to aim the bow/slingshot/hookshot felt good, but that is about it. There is absolutely nothing in this game that couldn\\'t have been done just as well on a traditional controller, nothing whatsoever. The most egrigious offender is the flying beetle item, and swimming. It is clumsy and awkward to control the beetle with much accuracy,as you have to point the remote at an extreme downward angle for the beetle to descend. As for the swmming, I was absolutely appalled and sickened that they would let such a sloppy mechanic into this game. I can understand the appeal of using the remote to replicate the sword movements, but to have to move around the remote to steer Link as he swims? Where the hell is the logic in that? Isn\\'t the whole point to make it more realistic, well what the hell is realistic about that? Same problem with the beetle, you have to move your wrist at very uncomfortable angles and is in general way too sensitive.That was what really convinced me that the whole thing was nothing more than one big gimmick.5 years of this type of controller and for this? Steering him while he swims? Absolutely inexcusable.There are a few other things in this game that I found equally outrageous. Little things in the grand scheme of things, but they served to detract a fair bit from my enjoyment. Your \"Partner\" in this game, Fi, (think Navi, or Midna) resides in your sword, and will show her ugly head all too frequently, serving almost exlusively to break up the fun you were having, and to point out something so unbelievably obvious you can\\'t help but wonder how stupid Nintendo must think you are. It comepletely spoils things when I figure out what to do next, and then this idiot comes up and tells me anyway, and takes way too long doing it. Similar annoyance are throughout the game, overlong explanations(sometimes even if you decline to hear a NPC\\'s explenation they will go ahead and explain it to you anyway), forced cut scenes and the like.What\\'s most ridiculous though, is that for all the unbelivably, offensively obvious things that Fi points out to you, she offers no assistance whatsoever when there is a genuinely confusing part and I\\'m not sure what to do. Which is it Nintendo? Am I such an unfathomable moron that I need my hand held and need to be spoon fed the easiest things in the entire game, or am I smart enough to complete the hardest of all the puzzles and challenges without any sort of hint?It\\'s stuff like this that just rubs me the wrong way and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. If Nintendo is trying to make the game more accesible for children, then they are completely off their mark; kid\\'s aren\\'t that stupid. No one is.All it does is annoy people and insult their fanbase.So all in all,The Legend Of Zelda is an incredible game, In many ways, a masterpiece. I was so touched by the story that I cried at the end. It sets the bar for the next Zelda in a big way.Unfortunately, it also shows at the same time that Nintendo is out of touch with reality. They want to force gimmicky garbage down our throats all while claiming it\\'s innovation. They won\\'t allow us to play with a traditional pad, even though it\\'s entirely feasible. They insult our intelligences with hand holding game buddies.A few minor tweaks here and there and this would have been a perfect 10/10 game all around, but they are so damn stuck in their ways they just couldn\\'t help themselves it seems. Skyward Sword is a bittersweet pill, but the good definitely outweighs the bad.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The fifth generation of gaming ended years ago and the sixth generation which brought in the PS3, Wii and Xbox 360 is almost on its way out thanks to Nintendo who is bringing in the Wii U some time next year. But since this a review specifically about the Wii, we\\'ll get to it right about.....now.Nintendo\\'s Wii is an interesting console although like most of the others before it, it is underpowered compared to the other two consoles currently for sale. For some reason, Nintendo thought it was best to go with a very similar graphics engine as the GameCube which was definitely last generation\\'s console. Not a good idea if you ask me. However, it doesn\\'t make this offering a lost cause. Once you set things up, you find out you can hook this bad boy up to the internet. You can access online features just like you would on a computer through the myriad channels Nintendo provides--this one in particular--titled The Internet Channel. Other channels you can use are the News and Weather channels (which keep you updated on their respective themes), the Nintendo channel that let\\'s you watch different video clips specified to either give you information on games or show you specific tutorials on how to beat certain parts of a video game or to find something that\\'s well hidden, etc. or the Wii Shop Channel which lets you buy games specifically for the Wii\\'s system called Wiiware or other classics for the Virtual Console. The Wii is also backwards compatible with ALL GameCube discs so that should be an added facet that pleases fans.Another thing from the get go that makes this console intriguing is its controller. Playing a game like Wii Sports for the first time could damn near well be enlightening. At best, the games are fun and super intuitive. My favorites are Tennis and Boxing. You see the Wii uses motion controls that are picked up by a sensor bar. Some have called them \"gimmicky\" which to an extent, I can agree but for many games out there they really, really work. And they work well.Lastly, I\\'d like to touch on the games. The Wii has a bunch of first party games and some third party games as well. I still haven\\'t experienced nearly enough of them to my liking, but maybe I\\'ll get there one day since the next system is backwards compatible (Thank God. Nintendo, never stop doing this for your systems! I don\\'t know why Sony doesn\\'t make all of their systems backwards compatible. It just makes more sense and is more convenient for us all!). OK. Rant over.Some of the really good first party titles are as follows: Super Mario Galaxy, Kirby\\'s Epic Yarn, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mario Kart Wii and New Super Mario Bros. (Sorry. That\\'s pretty much all I played that I was impressed with). Other titles I hear are great fun are Muramasa: The Demon Blade, Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Little King\\'s Story, Sonic: Sega All Star Racing, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Punchout, Metal Gear Slug Anthology and Donkey Kong Country: Returns.I happen to appreciate the system because it dared to be different in some way. I wasn\\'t super crazy about motion controls at first, but I got the hang of them eventually. It also has a web browser, a shop for new and old games alike and various other things to take up some of your time. I must say although I don\\'t play it as much as I would like to, I do love my red Wii. ^_^Final score ------> 4.25 stars.This review can also be found on gamespot under the name darksongbird.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"There is no honest question about it, The Legend Of Zelda has been one of the most definitive video game franchises of all time. Nintendo has shown that they have no signs of slowing Link and company down whatsoever. This year is a massive one for Link, he is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his first quest against the hateful Ganon. Along the way, he has made so many encounters with a great cast of friends from Zelda, to Midna from Twilight Princess, and so many others all in his quest for the tri-force. With all the hype surrounding the upcoming Skyward Sword for the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo said they weren't going to do much to celebrate the silver celebration of Zelda. What they have donw is brought out the classics. Not just for the Wii, but a revamped Ocarina for the new Nintendo 3DS, and honestly it is worth the tri-force.The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time 3D brings back the excitement and thrills of what made the Nintendo 64 classic, into a new generation of fans. The gameplay is just as amazing, as Link does what he needs to to reconnect the pieces of time, and search for the idol medallions through amazing quests from Hyrule, all the way to the Forest Temple, to Hyrule Castle. The graphics do look absolutely amazing, and the music has all been restored brilliant in shine from top to bottom. The challenge that Nintendo had by bringing the N64 classic stands absolutely tall. The control though is a bit more complex if you've never played the Nintendo 64 version, or don't have the Wii to download it through the Wii's virtual console. The control really puts you to the test as you fire weapons like the light arrow and slingshot with the 3DS motion sensor. It can be rough to get used to at first (unless you've played The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess for the Wii,) but after a bit of practice you'll get the swing of things. The music though has been brilliantly redesigned to fulfill the 3DS platform, but the gameplay is absolutely challenging.All in all, there have been few games right now that have been worth buying for the Nintendo 3DS, and honestly The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time 3D is one that is absolutely worth the price to play. I never did play it when it was made for the Nintendo 64, but honestly I am glad that I got the chance to for the Nintendo 3DS. It absolutely is worth the effort, and follows through with why games love the Nintendo 3DS. What Super Mario 64 was to the Nintendo DS when it came out in 2004, The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is that game to the 3DS. With other great Nintendo 64 games coming to the 3DS like Starfox 64 3D soon, it is going to be rough to equal the fun, but this is truly a must buy for the Nintendo 3DS, and Link and Zelda are so proud.Graphics: A-Sound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+\",\n",

It has been awhile since die hard Zelda fans have awaited to see Link's latest escapade, and how he is going to battle the force against Ganondorf. But with all that hype, there has been a lot of gamers who've still haven't mastered The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. The game which was a part of the Nintendo Wii's launch back in 2006, is honestly one of the most epic games die hard Zelda fans and Link heads have loved to play. Now it is back at a lower price, and still is worth the money.The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess brings out the action and fierceness as Link goes head to head, trying to battle the madness Ganondorf and his band of foes including a fire-breathing armoroed dragon, the paranoid King Zant, and the heart of Hyrule in a battle between good and bad. Along the way, Link will be possessed by a wolf spirit which will transform him into a wolf who is fierce and howls at the moon with the deepest might, all trying to save Hyrule. Along the way, he'll meet Midna, who helps him along the quest, and helps to merge the shadow world, and Hyrule from the depths of despair, also trying to get Midna back to her own world. The gameplay is fierce, and has so many challenges to master from swordfights and jousts, to puzzles and mind-blowing quests. Along the way, you'll also use weapons of aid from slingshots, and grappling hooks, to the use of iron boots which will help you walk on the watery floor. It really is a great quest that is truly epic to what The Legend had brought in for gamers for a quarter of a century. The control with the Wii takes a bit to get used to, compared to how Zelda fans have mastered it with the classic Gamecube and Nintendo 64 controls, while the music is still just as epic to why The Legend Of Zelda has shown to be as strong as the tri-force.With also the hype Nintendo has with a new system for gamer awaiting in the wings next year, and at a lower price for the Wii, now is absolutely a great time to buy The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It really is a epic game that is still just as masterful as why Link has been so epic all this time. When it has came down to The Legend Of Zelda: Twlight Princess, it has been one of the most exciting and challenging games Nintendo has ever made. It still was sadly overlooked in favor of the classic Wii Sports, and other Wii favorites like Super Mario Galaxy over the years, but is definitely worth the fight. I loved playing The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess when it came out nearly 5 years ago, and it definitely is worth taking the trip down Wii memory lane. While Wii gamers are anxiously awaiting Skyward Sword, they should give The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess a whirl if they have just bought the Nintendo Wii.Graphics: BSound: A-Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B+\",\n",

There still is a lot of joy around for those who are new to the Nintendo Wii. There have been some of their classic gems reduced in price, but the gameplay is still as strong. That has been the case with reduced prices for classics like The Legend Of Zelda\" Twilight Princess, and with Mario Super Sluggers. For Mario Super Sluggers, it has been honestly one of the most overlooked sports titles for the Nintendo Wii. It definitely showed back in 2009 that Mario was able to throw a real fastball fireball with a curved turn for a strike for gamers young and old. But now that it is available at a lower price, is it worth its money for new Wii gamers, absolutely.Mario Super Sluggers, a part of the new Nintendo Selects series for the Wii, brings in the heavy pitching as Mario, Luigi, and all of the classic characters go head to head at fun baseball action, as you try to duke it out in a pitchers\\' duel of fun. The game is a absolutely enjoyable action-packed sports game, as Mario and friends do whatever it takes from stopping Bowser from ruining the baseball island. It is honestly not rough, but as you play, you can unlock and play with Mario favorites from Wario, Donkey Kong, and classic favorites like Toad, the adorable Petey Piranha, Princess Peach and Donkey Kong. The graphics handle well, but the control is very simple to maintain, as you use your Wii-mote and nunchuck to pitch and run the bases, without being caught out on the fly. As you play, you also unlock new stadiums to play from the classic Mario Stadium, to Wario City with exploding manholes, to Bowser Jr.\\'s Playpen, with drawings that come to life and can attack, all the way to the doom and gloom of Bowser\\'s stadium. It is a fun and enjoyable game from start to finish that is thrilled with plumber-sized baseball action.All in all, despite being overlooked in favor of other Wii games, Mario Super Sluggers is still a fun and challenging baseball experience for anyone who loves Mario and friends in a great baseball match. It still isn\\'t too late to take a pitch with this fun Wii title, and it still is just as fun to play, as when it came out a few years back. I absolutely recommend this as a great buy for anyone whom didn\\'t yet buy it for the Nintendo Wii, or for anyone who just recently bought the Wii, as a great game at a inexpensive price. Mario Super Sluggers is definitely worth the money.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B for solo play, B 1/2+ for multiplayerOverall: B',\n",

Yet, with the recent announcement that Nintendo would stop making the Wii, and focus on the development of a new system to debut next year, has been a huge shocker. There still have been so many great games through the Wii's lifespan that have been so influental top to bottm, like Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and many others. But the biggest influence actually came from Wii Sports, a game that came with the Wii which showcased how versitile the system would deliver based on the motion of your movements. That showed a lot of great promise, then and now. But over a year ago, when Wii Sports Resort was released, it expanded what made Wii Sports so strongly. Now, it is available, without the motionplus adapter.Wii Sports Resort for the Nintendo Wii, brings in the gameplay of motion play well, but for this game, you would need the Wii-mote with built-in motion plus into the game, since this version doesn't come with that sensor add-on. Still, the game features great games top to bottom that handle well with the feeling of the motion of the Wii-mote, including returning games like bowling, and the thrills of jet skiing your way to the finish line, fighting sword to sword in a duel to the finish, or bicycling your way across the finish line, or taking free throws at the basketball hoops. The graphics handle well, but the gameplay is strong from start to finish. It definitely is a fun game to buy to pass the time away. Still, I was honestly hoping that there was a bit better with the multiplayer when I first played the game over a year ago.Unfortunately, if you don't have the Wii-mote with the built-in motion plus sensors, than you unfortunately won't be able to play Wii Sports Resort. It still is a fun and exciting game to pass the time for Wii gamers right now, until the next great game comes alive for the Wii. I still recommend Wii Sports Resort as a great buy for gamers start to finish, for anyone that hasn't yet had their fill of everything Wii.

       "   'reviewText': \"The quality of The Legend of Zelda series as a whole is practically unquestionable. Almost everything Nintendo sets out to do with the series is a success and comes out with flying colors. Phantom Hourglass successfully brought the series to the DS in a game that was great despite its flaws, and now Spirit Tracks is out as a sequel. It retains a lot of what made Phantom Hourglass great and improves upon the original game in some ways while feeling very similar despite its shortcomings and slow start.Spirit Tracks contains a story that bears little resemblance to any other game in the entire series. The game starts with Link, an aspiring engineer, leaving his little town to get an engineering license from Princess Zelda. Soon after the ceremony, Chancellor Cole and his rather powerful crony Byrne kidnap Zelda and separate her spirit from her body. Their goal is to eventually call the Demon King, Malladus, back out of his imprisonment and reside in Zelda's body, and after that cause who knows what kind of havoc and destruction. Fortunately, Link is able to see and communicate with the ghostlike Zelda, and they set out on an adventure to restore the Spirit Tracks around the land and stop Cole from resurrecting the Demon King.The story is mostly well done, with a solid start that is instantly gripping. The plotline doesn't carry itself through a large portion of the game very strongly, but rather uses that time to develop a unique relationship between Link and Zelda, which is a rather refreshing and charming change of pace for the series, seeing as the two have never spent much time together. Cole is a rather shallow villain made interesting and intriguing simply by his deception at the beginning of the game and entirely creepy behavior, but other characters such as the sages, namely Anjean, help keep the story going alongside Link and Zelda. It's a predictable tale, but it serves its purpose in adding something fresh to the series.The major new element in Spirit Tracks is the train. It is an odd and somewhat out of place object in the game seeing as it's the only part of Hyrule that is even partially industrialized: the rest is just as we remember it in all its medieval-times glory. The train is, obviously, Link's transportation from place to place for the entire game, and unfortunately this is where Spirit Tracks stumbles a bit. Train rides tend to get long, drawn out, and boring even early on in the adventure. There is a warp system, but unfortunately it is made sparse and completely inefficient due to the fact that pairs of warp gates link only to each other rather than just having all of the gates link together. The train is also essential in completing just about every side quest in the game, of which there are plenty, but the hassle of going from place to place diminishes the value a bit. Thankfully the game's length is satisfactory even without doing any side quests.Spirit Tracks, like its predecessor, structures itself around one central dungeon called the Tower of Spirits. Unlike Phantom Hourglass' Temple of the Ocean King, though, it is not necessary to redo the entire temple upon each visit; fans can breathe a huge sigh of relief. The Tower of Spirits is a solid dungeon that is unique in that Zelda is able to possess Phantoms, creating opportunities galore for creative puzzles involving the cooperation between Link and Zelda. By the time players reach the top floor, there will have been plenty of challenge and inventive puzzles along the way that were a treat to solve.Unfortunately the game does take its time in picking up the pace. From the game's start up through the third minor temple it's completely easy going, in fact I don't recall being stumped for more than 30 seconds on any given puzzle in that entire segment of the game. However, after the third dungeon, the game simply bursts at the seams and even explodes with the ingenuity and challenge that is to be expected from a Zelda game. There aren't very many items in the game, but the ones available are put to every use possible to push along the brilliant level design and puzzles.One of the greatest parts of Zelda games has always been the boss battles that incorporate the dungeon's new item in epic, large-scale fights, and Spirit Tracks fully delivers in this area as well. The monsters are always huge, sometimes taking up two screens, and even if a given boss isn't quite that large the battle will always utilize both screens for a better sense of atmosphere and camera angles. Defeating these monsters is usually not too difficult, but the fight is always so grand that watching them writhe in pain and disappear after the finishing blow is a victorious and satisfying moment.One of Phantom Hourglass' great achievements was making complete touch control work very well, and Spirit Tracks follows in that same path with little change. Running, slashing, using items, and any other action can be smoothly executed with simple touches or drags across the lower screen, and it all works about as well as its potential allows. Spirit Tracks also makes the best use of the DS' mike to date. One item allows you to blow a gust of wind by blowing into the mike and the Spirit Flute, an item reminiscent of the Ocarina of Time itself, is played by blowing and sliding the instrument across the bottom screen to play the correct notes. It all works very well and pulls together a simple, smooth, and effective control package.Playing the Spirit Flute is a treat not only because of the clever method of playing the instrument but also because of the music that must be played. Every tune played with the flute is delightfully charming and/or epic; in fact the same can be said about most of the game's other music tracks as well. The train riding music in particular is thrilling and epic, so at least the otherwise dull train rides have such great music to make it a little more enjoyable. I may have bashed the train a lot, but the music really is a bright point about it because it gives the rides a sense of wonder and adventure that otherwise would not have existed.Spirit Tracks pretty much looks the same as Phantom Hourglass. The animation is identical and it still looks pretty solid for a DS game, with smooth animations and remarkably expressive characters. Upon close inspection the graphics look fuzzy sometimes, namely the ground during train rides, but that aspect isn't the overwhelming one: Spirit Tracks is a good looking game overall.The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks may not be the best Zelda game out there, and its issues keep it from being notably better than its immediate predecessor, but it's still a great game overall. Its unique story, improved central dungeon, epic boss battles, use of DS functions, and excellent level design all contribute to its overall quality, despite the dull train rides and slow start. Once it gets going, though, it really gets going, and especially from the fourth dungeon and forward, Spirit Tracks is a great game that's worth playing through the slow start for the more than satisfying second half. Those who haven't played a Zelda game are still better off starting with Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, or Twilight Princess, but for Zelda fans Spirit Tracks is a must play.Positive:+ Refreshing story with a surprising beginning+ Tower of Spirits is a much-appreciated improvement+ Brilliant puzzles and level design in the later part of the game+ Epic and well-designed boss battles+ Controls make good use of the DS' abilities+ Fantastic soundtrack, especially the train riding musicNegative:- Train rides are long and boring despite the epic music- Warp system is sparse and inefficient- Slow and easy early on due to lack of difficulty8.4/10\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Darksiders - Circa 2010GOOD:- Tight controls and easy to use moves make doing combos as well as overall combat fun and furious.- Fun environmental puzzles that test your ability to recognize ways to solve them and progress. This really harkens back to a time when many games had environmental puzzles like Soul Reaver and other great of yore, most games today are only about the action and forget the exploration and \"good\" puzzle solving.- Great comic book inspired art style nothing in this game looks bland and all the enemies look/move great. Also the game has a great uses of color and gets away from using the many grays, browns, and blacks found in many other action games found today.BAD:- The story here is pretty by the numbers and forgettable but is sort of connected to the end of the world concerning four horsemen from the Book of Revelations in the Bible.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A 3D action beat-em-up type of game similar to that of Devil May Cry, where your beat up enemies using swords ands such with \"flashy combos\" just that this title can be over the top with violence it uses in its finisher moves like that found in God of War.- The game also has many environmental puzzles like that found in the famed Legend of Zelda series where you use items like boomerangs, gliding, and grappling hooks to find your way through the world and to your goals.- You play as mostly a silent protagonist named War (supposedly as one of the four horsemen from the Book of Revelations in the Bible) who is big as a tank (he would fit in with the crew from Gears of War bulk wise) but strikingly nimble and fights with a large sword.- Much like Zelda as well as Devil May Cry you can backtrack to any area and get items you missed and at certain points in the game you have to go back and backtrack to complete objectives. There is also a warp system to make travel easier.- At one point in the game you ride a griffon to get to a far location, this plays as an on-rails shooter and is very similar to gameplay found in Panzer Dragoon (Sega Saturn) or REZ (PS2).- Killing enemies grants you souls of different colors, green for health, yellow for your abilities meter, and blue for currency.- Almost all your upgrades, weapons, and items you have to buy from an in game store using collected souls of enemies that you slain (blue souls). There is a demon that runs this store and is a bit funny.- You also at different times in the game get a scythe as well as gauntlets for hand to hand combat, and even a gun.- Towards the end of the game you get an ability to make portals to a limited degree, this works much like the popular Valve game Portals, even to the point of having blue and orange colored portal openings.- About halfway into the game you get a Horse name Ruin, this horse can only be ridden in certain areas in the game (namely the desert area). While riding Ruin you can still hit enemies with your sword as well as shoot at them with your gun.- Pretty early in the game you will get a yellow meter under your life bar that fills when you get yellow souls, you can use the energy in this meter for a few different abilities like making spikes shoot from the ground to harm enemies, stone skin for extra defense as well as a poison mist that will harm enemies.- Later in the game you will get a type of rage meter that fills when you kill enemies, when this meter fills you can turn into (for a short time) a huge red and black looking demon that does massive damage and is invincible.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Dante\\'s Inferno (360, PS3)- God of War 3 (PS3)- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Wii)- Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (PS1, Dreamcast)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- All the art for the game was done by Joe Madureira AKA Joe Mad of 90\\'s Marvel comic fame, Joe Mad also had a popular but short lived comic series called Battle Chasers.- Those that pre-ordered this game or got it very early enough got a slip of paper with code to be entered at the THQ website for a free copy of Red Faction: Guerrilla, As well as a mixed media DVD with Darksiders videos as well as art.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Can Link do anything right these days? For all of the critical praise that the ongoing Legend of Zelda saga has received in recent years, the online backlash towards the past few entries has been harsh. While Twilight Princess and Phantom Hourglass introduced new wrinkles to the series, the dungeon-trekking foundation that's been in place since the original - or at least Link to the Past - is starting to feel creaky. Spirit Tracks, the latest Zelda and Nintendo's big handheld title from last fall, suggested that cartoony locomotives might be the solution, but unfortunately riding the rails is the worst part of an otherwise wonderful adventure.Phantom Hourglass was unusual in that it followed the events of 2003's The Wind Waker, instead of just hitting the traditional Hyrule reset button. If you've seen any cel-shaded Spirit Tracks screens, then you've probably realized that this game is another direct sequel. Unlike PH, this game takes place 100 years after Tetra, the King of Red Lions and all of that time-consuming sailing. It's clear that this is the same world though, with plenty of references to the old toon games sprinkled throughout.The leap in time means that the world has dried up, so wheels are required to get to each isolated outpost. I figure we should get the bad stuff out of the way first: traveling via train is a snooze. While the boat always offered some freedom of movement, the tracks in place only allow 90 degree turns, and there's just not much to explore in between. I know that some of you tired of changing wind direction or that heinous Triforce fetch quest at the end of WW, but if you look at it objectively, there were tons of little treasures and uncharted islands scattered around too. In Spirit Tracks, you've got some randomly spawning enemies, some rabbits and...well, that's about it.These long stretches of nothingness are made even longer thanks to the slow default engine speed and one-hit-killer locomotives patrolling near major junctions. You can upgrade parts of your train at a trading post later in the game, and warp points are uncovered if you complete side quests, but the reality is that you'll be spending about a third of the adventure shoveling coal and fighting boredom.The good news is that almost everything else about Spirit Tracks is wonderful. This is not the radical departure from the series' traditions that you may have been hoping for, but it is a much more refined handheld Zelda than Phantom Hourglass (and I thought PH was great already).From a storytelling standpoint, Spirit Tracks is surprisingly sophisticated. The villain is a toon-shaded dweeb and the imminent release of a big bad demon is familiar, but the direction of the cutscenes and the expressiveness on the characters' faces still shine.  This particular world always appealed to me more than the Tolkien-lite Ocarina offshoots, and this game looks really sharp whenever the camera zooms in. And while I expect nothing less from Nintendo's localization wizards, the witty script - with plenty of old-school callbacks - endears too.There's still some overworld exploration (which unfortunately puts you back in that conductor's seat), but you'll spend most of your time solving puzzles in the handful of dungeons. Again, it's familiar - find a new tool/weapon, track down the boss and collect your hear piece - but the designs rely less on obvious riddles compared to PH. Touch screen controls still feel great, especially when you're swinging across a chasm with your grappling hook or blowing into your mic to create whirlwinds with a big leaf.The main elemental dungeons are fun, but the return trips to the central Tower of Spirits are where Spirit Tracks comes closest to matching Link's Awakening as the best portable Zelda. In each of these segments, there are no new items to collect, boss keys to find or anything else to distract you from your ascent to the top. (OK, those droplets of light might qualify, but you gather them pretty quickly.) It's just Link and Zelda against the series' most devious puzzles, which play with perspective and almost every ability at your disposal.And yes, I did say Zelda. Nintendo has not hidden the fact that the titular princess is along for the ride as a disembodied spirit. After you strike tower guards from behind, she can possess their armor. In her clunky suit, Zelda can walk over lava and spikes. Better yet, her increased strength allows her to push hefty boulders and carry Link to safety. If you enjoyed the two partner dungeons in The Wind Waker, you'll have a ball here.While I wish these moments made up the entire game, the level design is strong enough to overshadow those bumpy train rides. I hope that Nintendo is using a new blueprint for the next Wii Zelda, but this DS entry shows that the old formula is still relevant.*In case you're wondering, I didn't get to try the multiplayer mode. Nintendo axed wi-fi support, so if you ran a Phantom Hourglass clan, you might want to reconsider your purchase.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"When it does come down to the Nintendo Wii, they definitely have raised the bar when it comes to innovation. That has been shown in their appeal of the way video games are played very strongly, even when it does come behind the wheel. With the success of racing giant Mario Kart Wii, as the biggest-selling video game last year, many wonder how Nintendo is going to keep that stride to the checkered flag. That sadly wasn't the case when Excite Truck was launched for the Wii back in 2006. The game was sadly overlooked by gamers, in favor of other gems like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Wii Sports. Well, the Excite series is set to take a more extreme turn again on the Wii, and this time, it is a bit strange trying to stay extreme.Excitebots: Trick Racing for the Nintendo Wii, feeds off of the appeal Excite Truck had, and brings it in to a whole new level of gaming. The gameplay is as similar to Excite Truck was, but with a few interesting twists. The biggest twist is as you race your way as one of many animal-inspired robotic cars, including the grasshopper, frog, mouse, and beatle. While it might seem weird, it is actually a surprise. The control is similar to what Excite Truck had to offer, by steering with the Wii-mote like it was a steering wheel, but also can be compatable with the Wii-wheel attachment that came with Mario Kart Wii as well.The gameplay is similar to Excite Truck as well, as you make your way racing to the top by scoring stars by pulling off extreme stunts like mid-air jumps, pulling off 360 spins, crashing into other vehicles, pulling outrageous stunts, like ring jumps, and new twists like swinging on metal bars, and more weird, but surprising things like scoring a soccer goal while driving, to attempting to make a bowling strike, and even throwing pies at clown faces. That is important, because it isn't just about getting 1st Place, it is also about scoring more stars, to unlock newer vehicles and getting newer places to race like Egypt, Mt. Kilimanjaro, and China. I also do like the idea that now you can race against others online here too see if you are #1.Sadly though, there actually are a few disadvantages with Excitebots: Trick Racing. The biggest disadvantage is that unlike Mario Kart Wii, where you can race as many as 12 different racers online, here you can only race against as many as 6 different racers through the Wi-Fi connections, which honestly doesn't pull off all the stops. The second disadvantage is that I was surprised to find out that you can't control the game with the Classic or Nintendo Gamecube controllers here, unlike Mario Kart Wii. Although staying similar to what Excite Truck had to offer when it came out in controls and gameplay, yet it still might leave gamers feeling like they wanted more.All in all, despite a few faults, Excitebots: Trick Racing feels a bit weird in the race at first, but actually is a big surprise that is sure to please racing fans, who want strange and trippy-tricked out racing to a whole new level of fun. I think the game is challenging, but is sure to please Wii fans that might felt that the Nintendo Wii hasn't offered enough in awhile for the need of great games.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B 1/2-Fun & Enjoyment: B- for solo players; B 1/2- for multiplayerOverall: B-\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I'm an old school Nintendo fan.  The Legend of Zelda for NES came out when I was like 13, and I must have finished it a dozen times or more.  I've also played every Zelda game since (except for the gameboy ones), and I've always loved them.I love Twilight Princess too.  It's a great game.  It's probably got the best story of any of the Zelda games... or at least the way the story is presented is the best.  Unfortunately, there's a lot not to like about it.  First of all, there isn't much to do.  There are only 2 side quests that I can think of (collecting bugs and poes), and doing them isn't really the height of fun.  Also, I hated every second of being stuck as a wolf.  It was okay when I could switch back and forth, but way too much of the beginning of the game forces you to be the wolf, and the game is extremely limited when that happens.  Also, the targeting system isn't so good.  It's inconsistent at best, and downright broken at worst.  This was also kind of a problem with Ocarina of Time, but it's more noticeable here for some reason.This is a huge game world.  At completion, I had clocked in at 72 hours of play, and there were things I still hadn't done.  I really explored the hell out of this game, though, so if you're a fast run and gun type of player, you can probably beat it in 40 or so.  The thing is, for all that exploring, I didn't find much.  If I was lucky, I found a hidden cavern with rupees or possibly a heart piece, but mostly it's just empty space with a few scattered enemies.  The dungeons were really well made, with interesting puzzles, but most of the time, the special items you get from the dungeons will never be used once you've completed them.. and that's kind of a waste.So... I guess that my review is all over the place, but so is the gameplay in Twilight Princess.  One minute you'll be swearing that it's the best game ever, and the next minute you'll be bored stiff and ready to get somewhere interesting.I say it's worth it for the well told and tight story (a first for a Zelda game).  If you can look past the shortcomings, you'll have a lot of fun with it.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"Okami is probably the most stylistic and artistically engaging game on the Wii, to date.  The bright, bold colors and amazing art style feels like a Japanese painting.  Some people will disagree with me, but I feel the graphics are superior on the Wii compared to the PS2 version, although the parchment paper filter is no where near as pronounced in this game.  That's a shame, but unless you've played the PS2 version, it isn't that big of an issue.The game is impossible to play without drawing comparisons to Zelda games, and it is a fair and obvious comparison.  Playing as Amaterasu the sun goddess, you interact with the world through her white wolf avatar and by using the celestial brush.  The celestial brush is downright cool.  You will draw a manner of objects to complete puzzles and can even use some of your drawings as attacks.  There is a bit of a learning curve and it requires a steady hand, but the mechanic works.As you adventure through the game your actions will gradually rejuvenate and rebuild a devastated world that has been consumed by evil.  As you fight enemies and use the celestial brush to build bridges, draw rivers, complete constellations, and grow trees, the world becomes more and more lush as you play.  It is a visual feast and what is even better is that you actually have some control over how portions of the world look.All is not well in Okami, though.  For example, the combat controls.  Those take getting used to.  For those of you that played Zelda: Twilight Princess, the combat controls will be a bit of a rude awakening.  They aren't broken, but they are not nearly as accessible as Twilight Princess.  Timing your melee attacks is very important if you want to chain your combos together.  It will take some practice.  Or, you can do like I do and attack everything with the celestial brush drawings.Okami Pros:===> Stunning stylistic graphics.===> A huge adventure based upon Japanese legend and myths.===> The celestial brush is just plain cool.===> Awesome boss battles that require using all of your celestial brush skills.  Definitely a highlight of the game.Okami Cons:===> Camera control is kind of clumsy and could have been implemented in a better manner.===> Melee combat controls are stiff and difficult to master.  You'll probably resort to using the celestial brush more than anything else in combat.===> Clover Studios, the original developer is no longer in business and we will not be seeing any sequels to Okami.  That is just sad and makes kittens cry because Clover Studios was a brilliant development house.I would rate the game as family friendly.  In fact, it is almost as much fun to watch as it is to play.  It is a good game for players of most ages, but I think the learning curve would be a little too steep for younger children and the plot would be a little too obscure for most.  There are a couple of very tame sexual innuendo references and numerous references to alcohol and alcoholism, sake wine to be specific, but it isn't overt.  Some parents may be surprised, but honestly there are Disney, Pixar, and Dreamworks movies that are infinitely more offensive.  Half an hour of prime-time television would damage a child's psyche more than this game ever could.Overall, I highly recommend this game to fans of the Zelda franchise, anyone who enjoys Japanese culture, or anyone looking for a unique gaming experience.  I won't say that it is better than Zelda, but it compares favorably.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Graphics--------Graphically, Super Mario Galaxy is not as detailed as some other titles (The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix); however, we can overlook that and just ask whether the graphics are appropriate for a Mario title. The answer to that question is a resounding yes. Many games are inconsistent between movie cutscenes and gameplay, but this Mario title never misses a beat. There are lots of bold solid colors, minimal shading, minimal anti-aliasing, and almost no shadows or lighting effects. This is deliberate, and evokes the feel of the original Mario title (and so I\\'m told the Mario 64 title, which I have never played).This lack of detail conveniently also allows the game to work nearly flawlessly on the Wii with almost no frame rate issues (the exception being at least one of the underwater sequences - water is hard to animate). It does tend to look a little jagged at times on larger screens because of the Wii\\'s limited output resolution, but it\\'s an acceptable sacrifice. Overall, I give it a 4/5 stars for graphics. I suspect that future titles will find ways around the Wii\\'s graphical limitations, and we\\'ll see better-looking games with the same or better performance, but for a relatively early title it looks pretty darn good.Music / Sound-------------This is where Galaxy shines. A lot of the music is fully orchestrated, and it blends almost seamlessly with the more electronic musical themes, including all of the old favorites. They have cleverly layered multiple tracks so that they can switch between them to add or subtract additional orchestration at key moments (like when you set Bowser spinning around the planet, the orchestra suddenly chimes in much louder), and even the sound effects (with a few exceptions) are engineered so that they stay in the same key as the music. This is all designed to make the game as immersive as possible, and they pull it off beautifully. (Incidentally, this multi-layered musical approach was also used to great effect in Twilight Princess. Other game manufacturers really ought to pay attention to this and consider using this technique for their own games.) I give the music and sound easily 5/5 stars.Controls--------The main problem that I\\'ve found is that the Nunchuk thumb controller is a little hard to steer accurately. Also, there are times when you really want to adjust the camera *just so* and the game just won\\'t let you do it. This gets frustrating when you\\'re forced to jump over chasms at awkward angles. Part of this is deliberate (for example, when gravity changes, you can\\'t adjust the world to be right-side up and you have to compensate), but at other times it just seems like poor implementation. It seems to me that using the Wiimote pointer would be the \"right\" way to aim the camera, but instead they force you to use an awkward combination of the D-pad and the Nunchuk\\'s C button. There is a way to temporarily look at your situation in first-person view, but it\\'s rarely useful and frustrating to control. I also had a great deal of trouble controlling Mario underwater, and flying was really quite frustrating.Other than that, the controls are fairly smooth and responsive. The use of the Wiimote pointer to pick up starbits is very efficient, and the Z button works pretty well to do long jumps and back-flips, although if you\\'re not lined up exactly right (darn camera!) you\\'ll go flying off the edge of a cliff pretty quickly.The 2-player option is surprisingly useful for later levels where you\\'re too focused on not dying to worry about picking up star bits, so you can have a buddy focus on that and provide you with cover fire. While not the best feature of Galaxy, it\\'s an appreciated and useful addition. Overall, I give the controls 3/5 stars.Overall Gameplay----------------As just about everyone else in the world has pointed out, the level design is phenomenal. There will be countless moments when you look at an upcoming challenge, ponder it for a moment, and then mutter \"Oh!\" when you figure out what you have to do to overcome it. Then, you\\'ll probably say to yourself, \"How clever!\" Almost every level has a new and totally unique challenge of some sort. The new Mario suits, which are required to complete your quest, range from the familiar to the rather bizarre. Far from just being power-ups, each suit poses its own unique challenges and limitations.Each level takes roughly 10-15 minutes to complete - perfect for a quick break between other activities. I like to do the dishes, take a quick Mario break, then go fold some laundry, etc. My only complaint was that if you do save your game and reload, you start back at the observatory and lose all of your extra lives. (Granted, free Marios are exceptionally easy to come by, so this is more of a quibble, although the first time I saw it happen I was a bit taken aback.)For the exceptional creativity, level of challenge, secret levels and entertaining sub-plots, I give Mario a 5/5 for sheer entertainment value.Replayability-------------For the most part, once you\\'ve figured out how to conquer a particular puzzle, you don\\'t really need to tackle it again. Therefore, I\\'m not sure how replayable this particular title is, as the details of the levels don\\'t really change much (once you\\'ve gathered all of the stars from the area). I think some of you might enjoy replaying past levels and trying to better your coin totals. I don\\'t get much out of that personally. I give it roughly 3/5 for replayability, meaning, I wouldn\\'t trade the game in after I beat it, but I\\'m not sure I would play it again afterwards.I might consider playing through some of the levels with a second player around to help out, or perhaps I\\'d be the second player just to see exactly how much I can contribute.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'I am a 23 year old college grad who has been playing video games for about 18 years. I have fond memories of my original Nintendo and playing Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt back in the day. It has taken me 14 months to finally get my hands on a Nintendo Wii and I am very happy that I own one.I\\'d like to start off my review by stating that I bought the Nintendo Wii primarily for its Virtual Console feature. I have long since abandoned my Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis consoles. Those were the consoles I owned throughout my childhood; the Virtual Console feature would allow me to go back and get back in touch with my childhood. I have recently purchased classic games such as Super Mario 3, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Metroid, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Donkey Kong Country; this was a wonderful idea on Nintendo\\'s part!I do agree with some users who say that this system is grossly underpowered when compared to its big brothers, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. When playing on an HDTV, the Nintendo Wii just doesn\\'t stack up. I also agree that although the $250 price point is lower than the competition, you need to add many accessories (component cables, Nunchuk, Classic Controller, etc) to get less features than the competition. In all honesty, this console isn\\'t cheap at all...I actually think that the PS3 is a much better value, but that\\'s a whole different story.I am satisfied with my Nintendo Wii because I do NOT regard it as my primary gaming console. I am proud to announce that my PlayStation 3 is my gaming console of choice. However, the Nintendo Wii is a perfect compliment for my PS3. Sometimes I just want to play some old school 16-bit classic games...Sometimes the simplicity of the older games is what I am looking for. I love the fact that the Wii is completely compatible with Nintendo Gamecube games. There are a couple of fantastic Gamecube exclusive games that I missed playing; now I have the opportunity to play these games at a low price!Games developed on the Nintendo Wii generally force you to be more \"involved\" in the game. Wii Sports is obviously the best example of this, but I also like to use the example of Tiger Woods Golf. The console brings people together and that\\'s what games are supposed to do. Compared to a PS3, the Nintendo Wii is far less intimidating to the average person.Nintendo has proven time and time again that they are the best game developers in the business. Yes, they reuse a lot of their franchises over and over and over, but they always find a way to come up with such polished and such well designed products. Nintendo console exclusives have won numerous Game of the Year awards in the past couple of years. Some examples are: Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Resident Evil 4, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Metroid Prime. Super Smash Brothers Brawl should also be an excellent exclusive title.I would argue that the overwhelming majority of games on the Nintendo Wii are mediocre at best. BUT...as I stated above, the Nintendo Wii is home to, and is backwards compatible with some of the best games of all-time. In this case, I preach quality over quantity with respect to the games.Yes, the controller maybe gimmicky. Yes, the graphics are really poor in comparison to the competition. Yes, Nintendo reuses the same franchises over and over and over. Does that make the games any less fun? The answer is a resounding NO!Nintendo has proven that it has struck a chord with the casual gaming market with the Wii. It offers a different type of video game experience and in many ways, that\\'s a refreshing thing. We\\'re also talking about Nintendo here...these guys simply know how to make fantastic video games with or without third party support. These guys aren\\'t going anywhere, anytime soon so expect to see at least 2-3 AAA quality games per year. For me, that\\'s more than enough.For me, the Nintendo Wii is a perfect compliment to my PS3. In fact, I traded my Xbox 360 for a Nintendo Wii primarily because of the Virtual Console feature and the occasional AAA exclusive.I wouldn\\'t necessarily advise people to get a Nintendo Wii as a primary console because I don\\'t think it is the best console on the market (PS3), but as sales show, it succeeds with casual gamers and in many ways, also succeeds with this hardcore gamer.',\n",

While the game system has generated so much buzz, it has also been proven to still be just as hard to sell to gamers with limited supply. That also could've been said with The Legend Of Zelda that way too. After the mammoth success of The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, many Wii owners have been anxious for a new way to play around with Link and all his missions against the vulgarous Ganon. That unfortunately, will have to wait awhile. But, there is a new add-on that can help you play around with Link for just a little while longer on the Wii, in a new way.The new Wii Zapper is a sleek and convient device that turns your Wii remote and nunchuck controller, into a new handy gun peripheral, something Nintendo hasn't delivered since the original NES Zapper for Duck Hunt. The Zapper is easy to setup for any Wii owner and is convient to use with the new Resident Evil title. You can also use this with Link's Crossbow Training, a simple way to shoot out your bows against foes in Hyrule. The game plays well, as you play through 19 different levels to try to shoot at your opponents from demons, and other opponents. The graphics stand well, but the gameplay is actually very addictive to gamers young and old. The control is very simple to use, as you guide your Wii nunchuck controls around ad launch your arrows with a blink of an eye. It also unlike games like Dance Dance Revolution and Rock Band is a lot cheaper to buy, but keeps the peripherals at a affordable price.All that I can say though is that I really am hoping the Wii Zapper doesn't fade into limited obscurity like other Nintendo add-ons like the DK Bongo Drums for Donkey Kong Jungle Beat from the Gamecube. As for Link's Crossbow Training, it follows well as a great game for solo play, or with multiplayer action that is worth while, but I just wish it could be a bit more challenging.Graphics: B 1/2+Sound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: BOverall: B\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Overall I enjoyed this game a great deal.  It did a very good job of integrating the unique features of the DS with classic \"Zelda style\" puzzles.  The stylus was a bit awkward at first, but the levels seemed to be designed with this in mind, so you had plenty of time to get comfortable before needing to do anything with a great deal of efficiency. Combat is the only area where adjusting to the stylus seems like a gimick, or just a hassle to make it a \"DS game\", everything else the stylus does (navigating the ship, drawing on maps, making notes for yourself, drawing paths for boomerangs, grappling hooks and bombchus) is a MAJOR convenience.  I felt ridiculous having to take pen and paper notes while playing Wind Waker, just so that I could remember where things were on that absurdly large map.  If I want to remember a special feature of an island in Phantom Hourglass though, all I have to do is write on the map!The dialogue is much funnier than most Zelda games (which is saying something, because there is usually a pretty sharp wit written into at least a couple of characters), the graphics are nice for the DS. The music is pretty bland in the context of other Zelda titles, but this doesn\\'t detract from the game at all so it\\'s no big deal. All of the usual suspects are there as far as items go (boomerang, bow, hookshot/grapple, hammer, shovel) but the stylus control gives a few of them (especially the boomerang) a make over that expands their usefulness.  The lack of bottles and heart pieces was kind of weird, but not a deal breaker by any means.Not everything about this game is great though.  It is pretty easy, which wouldn\\'t be a negative, but there are times when your helper fairy (there has been some version of this in every Zelda game since Ocarina of Time) literally walks you through puzzles.  I don\\'t know if it is because they expect a younger audience on a handheld (minish cap was really bad about this as well), but I do not like this, it takes away from my favorite part of the game (ie getting that euphoric jolt of accomplishment when I solve a puzzle all on my own!).Then there is the combat.  Wow, talk about a step back! It started with Legend of Zelda: Four Swords, and continued in Wind Waker, where it felt like the designers had put a lot of thought into making the combat exciting and chaotic.  It was special because for the first time ever it felt like there was an element of skill involved with Zelda combat.  If you knew a few moves and how to use your items effectively, you could take on dozens of enemies at once... and you were given several opportunities to do so! This was exciting! Twilight Princess altered things slightly, going from a \\'take on the world\\' combat ideology, to more of a stealthy/duel based ideology.  So while you didn\\'t have the chaos of the aforementioned titles, there was still plenty of intensity and skill in the combat sequences. But in the Phantom Hourglass, you hardly fight at all! I understand that part of this has to do with the physical limitations inherent with the stylus control scheme (ie no targetting, only 1 item equipped at a time etc.), but it is still disappointing.And I guess the only problem I have with the weak combat system is that in the few instances where you are put into a challenging fight, you have to use gimicks and tricks instead of making creative use of items and showing off well polished sword skills. And that is in the best case, in some instances (such as the final boss battle in the game) it simply boils down to a mind numbing test of patience.That wasn\\'t enough to bring down my overall enjoyment of the game though. Despite being easy the puzzles were very creative, which is nice since the whole \"light the torch, flip the switch, push the block\" thing gets kind of old.  The DS specific features (drawing on the maps etc.) went over very well, and the game as a whole was very funny. A little more depth/length would have been nice, but you can\\'t ask for everything.I still need to try out the multiplayer, it looks like it will be a blast, but I haven\\'t had a chance to get online with it yet, so I can\\'t comment there. I do know that the last Zelda title to have a multiplayer option (Four Swords) was easily the best non-PC multiplayer experience I have ever had.',\n",

So here\\'s another entry...The Legend of Zelda on Nintendo DS.  Fans of the series should know what to expect, this game is really no different from any of the other ones.  What made this one fresh is the fact that it\\'s on one of the most innovative consoles ever, bringing that innovation to the Zelda series.This is a direct sequel to GameCube\\'s The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.  While that game isn\\'t the strongest entry (that honor goes to Ocarina of Time for N64), the cartoon look and humor fits quite nicely with the DS and I personally wouldn\\'t have it any other way.  All the usual Zelda elements are there, but this time you control with the stylus, which makes playing it all the more fun.  Sword-fighting is done by simply touching the enemy or making a slash mark.  The boomerang is used by tracing the path you want it to follow (this is simply ingenious!).  Your ship\\'s course is determined by tracing the path you want it to follow.  The fact that you can also write notes on the game\\'s map is very useful too.Story-wise, it\\'s simple and to-the-point.  Obviously, Nintendo wanted to focus more on gameplay than story, and that\\'s not a bad thing. The dungeons are rather short, but again, simplicity is rampant in this game.  I really like the incorporation of the microphone!  While it doesn\\'t have speech recognition, you can simply blow in the mic to make things happen.  I\\'m not a fan of having to do the main dungeon over and over again.  That will definitely get tedious.  The roll move is somewhat difficult to execute, which takes away from the otherwise brilliant play control.My biggest complaints stem from aspects that have been done before in other games.  The fairy that accompanies Link speaks for him and also suffers from memory loss, which is identical to Tippi the Pixl from Super Paper Mario (they even look similar).  Also, in the main dungeon, Link\\'s life will slowly drain unless he\\'s in designated \"Safe Zones\", which is straight out of Dark Aether from Metroid Prime 2.  Sure they change that up slightly with the use of the Phantom Hourglass, but that just serves to make the game somewhat on the easy side.  Incidentally, Metroid Prime 2 borrowed part of its gameplay (light and dark worlds) from Zelda: A Link To The Past, so I guess the favor is returned?Overall, however, this is probably one of the best games for the DS.  It certainly will keep you occupied and coming back for more.  While those looking for an expansive Zelda epic like Twilight Princess will undoubtedly be disappointed, this wasn\\'t the point of Phantom Hourglass and it should still satisfy fans.  It\\'s a strong entry in the Legend of Zelda series.',\n",

That has been the case with great games that really showed it like Excite Truck and the dramatic The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. With all that said about great games, mini-game excitement has also delivered too with the return of the Mario Party series. It has been almost 2 years since the franchise had its last game on the Nintendo Gamecube, and worked like a charm by being innovative and fun for all ages. Now, it has finally made its way onto the Wii, but is it worth the wait.Mario Party 8 for the Nintendo Wii is a wild and addictive game that brings out a simplicity for gamers young and old alike, as you unlock and play over 70 minigames that are easy and fun to play. There are also a few new additions here too, as you can also unlock players including Blooper, the sea squid from the Super Mario Brothers games, and Hammer Brothers, which recently returned in a great set of guest cameos in Super Mario Strikers and Mario Superstar Baseball. The graphics are delightful but the gameplay is definitely what brings the game to its success, as you use the Wii remote to play in games like waving a magic wand and using an energy ball to strike Bowser in a one on one showdown, punching a statue to smitherines with a boxing glove, or using it you are shaking a soda can and creating a gusher in one of the duel minigames. You can also use your Mii characters that you've created from games like Wii Sports and have them play in the Star Carnival and play games like ping pong. The graphics are delightful and the sound carries well throughout each of the boards, but the gameplay really does deliver for new Wii owners as well as die hard Mario fans alike.All in all, Mario Party 8 is a delightful game that welcomes the party franchise Wii owners well. I loved what the series brought out for so many years, and I know that this edition does a great job as well. Considering there are so many great games coming out for the Nintendo Wii like Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree, this one is definitely a wonderful addition to your Wii library.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo players; A- for Multiplayer ActionOverall: B+\",\n",

Let\\'s face it, Ocarina of Time set a standard for Zelda games that\\'s not yet been surpassed. Wind Waker was a master piece of creativity & imagination, but it lacked the epic feeling of Ocarina Of Time & Majora\\'s Mask. But Nintendo really hit their mark with this one! They combined all of the best aspects of Ocarina of Time, Majora\\'s mask, & Wind Waker to make a truely unique and fresh feeling adventure. It\\'s got amazing graphics, a great new (darker) story, wonderful new charecters, and an all new feel all it\\'s own.I paid 49 dollars & 99 cents for my purchase of this game, and although I would have liked it to be cheaper, I dont regret buying it at all... In my opinion, it was worth every penny.Pros:A brand new Zelda adventure, taking the breath-taking visuals, beautiful landscapes, and mystical feeling of Ocarina of Time, combined them with the ability to trasform in order to solve puzzles, gain new abilities, defeat enemies, and overcome obsticles from Majora\\'s mask with the fluid game play, unique charecter designs/personalities, and inspired sword fighting machanics from Wind Waker to form a truely epic adventure and another chapter in the ongoing Legend of Zelda series!Cons:I only have 2 major complains about this game... #1, No voice acting or spoken dialogue of any kind! (Unless you count Midna\\'s chattering) & #2, this game was originally going to be called \"The Legend of Zelda: Reign of Sorrow\" (a much more fitting title for an epic of this calibur) \"Twilight Princess\" is a name more fitting for a Barbie video game than a Zelda game in my opinion. But other than that, I have absolutely NO complaints!

There have been a lot of great games for it like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Excite Truck. Sadly, many gamers have been anxiously waiting the new Super Mario Galaxy, and hoping Mario would deliver again. Unfortunately, gamers will have to wait. However, a different Mario game has arrived from the die hard Paper Mario franchise from the gamecube and Nintendo 64 eras. There also is something that makes this paper seem better than flat, but will it satisfy Mario fans for now?Super Paper Mario for the Nintendo Wii, brings nack what made the Paper Mario games deliver in true role play. This time around, the game really does think out of the box, as Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser try to tackle the vicious Count Bleck and his minions Mr. L, Dimentio and others, as they tackle a fierce and wild world that seperates from the flipside and flopside. Each character has to unlock pixels, which help you through achievements from finding hidden doors, to lifting bosses. There are over 30 different levels in the game that bring back the classic 2-D side-scrolling action from the original Super Mario Brothers, with a different twist. Each character you play has a special ability. Peach and Luigi have a high jump, Bowser has the traditional fire-blazes, but Mario has the best ability. He can flip his world from a 2-D, to 3-D, to find hidden items and unlock hidden areas. The graphics in the game are absolutely beautiful, and really bring the classic gameplay into a whole new perspective, while the control is really on target most of the time. You do get a bit frustrated finding the unlocked doors, but everything else works like a charm. The story line also is fun and entertaining in each world of the game, while the story is cute but enjoyable for all the worlds.All in all, Super Paper Mario is a well-rendered game for the Wii, and should entice new Mario fans, as well as those waiting Super Mario Galaxy. I really like this game because it is fun and exciting, for all ages and Nintendo junkies. This is one of the best games for the Wii, and any owner will love this game a lot.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B 1/2-Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B 1/2+',\n",

But, with the success of the new system, many people have had a very difficult time finding the games for it, and the accessories too. The Wii Remote ha worked so well at changing the way we play the games on television so well, it just is more fun to play video games on television. When the Wii came out, it came with Wii Sports, a game that flexed our muscles at how we play baseball, bowling, and tennis. Now, another game is trying to do the same thing, but does it work?Wii Play for the Nintendo Wii, feels like a spin-off to Wii Sports, as you play and conquer through several different mini-games and table sports like billiards, table tennis and table hockey. The gameplay is simple to use with the Wii remote, which also comes with the game, as a convient price. There are some highlights like the shooting range, which brings back the classic gameplay from the NES classic Duck Hunt. The graphics look nice, and the control handles very well. Still, there are a few disadvantages with the game. One of them is the lack of challenge on some of the games, with billiards you only play a 9-ball game, rather than other variations like 15 or 10-ball. Another disadvantage, is that there could've been more games to play with like shuffleboard, to add on to the excitement.Still, Wii play works great as a multiplayer game, but for single player action, it really isn't exciting. Nevertheless, you do get a great bargain for the game, because of the Wii remote, which seperately costs $40 alone. I still recommend this game for anyone who the extra remote, and for some classic parlor fun.Graphics: B+Sound: B-Control: BFun & Enjoyment: C+ for solo players; B- for multiplayer actionOverall: B-\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'After a very very very long wait, one of the most long anticipated video games of all time was finally released on December(dont remember the date)for the Nintendo Gamecube and that my friends is The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess.  I\\'m not going to get into the plot or such and such because half of these reviews will tell it way better then me.  So let me to the simple stuff and what nots to give a little closure on how I felt about this awesome yet very delayed game....put simply..Twilight Princess is an awesome game that shows that Nintendo hasn\\'t got close to being stale on this amazing and most LEGENDARY series of all time.  The game boosts what is hands down one of the most beautifully made game ever, seriously if you thought that little purple cube had no life in it anymore think again cause TP boosts some of the best graphics scene on the gamecube since..RE4?  The Art style they took was a big leep for Nintendo and has a very more darker artsy look then the last Zelda game(Wind Waker) which was one of the best looking games on the cube as well but I prefer this darker, more realistic looking zelda game then the other.  From Zoras Domain(Man the first time I was there in the Twilight World, My jaws dropped to the floor)to Sky Temple the game is chuckfull of atmospheric details richly desighned to show that Zelda Has changed its look and feel......but still play EXACTLY the same as the others which sadly gets to my negative pointsAnyone scene God Of War 2?...hate to say this and im no fanboy, no siree but when you see that games trailer you say \"Man they really wanted to top the first one\" by adding so many new things and mechanics/battles/scenery/ect...This is something I wish Twilight Princess did.  Don\\'t get me wrong I love the game, its visuals, scenery, dark blah whatever you wanna call it...but it plays just like the other zelda games and I\\'ve just about had it...I told this to a friend the other day but I was hoping for something along the lines of like \"Link ontop of dragons trying to slay other mini dragons flying and ect\"  Yeah I know that sounds a bit much but this game was basically Ocarina of Time with a darker, more realistic look to it.  I liked the fact that you can change to a wolf and stuff but as you progress through the game its basically the same pattern(Do some plot quests..Twilight Realm as Wolf to do some little fetch quest...Temple..rince and repeat.)  I was really sucked into the game but by the time i was on the 6th temple it started to ware off.  Also I don\\'t like the jaggie Lines that the games has(it shows up from time to time..usually in an area with all the same colors and ect on the back round)which is what Wind Waker suffered as well..but again that still doesnt change the 10/10 graphics the game has..it just interferes at times.  Also did I mention this has some pretty bad music.  Nintendo should have just kept the old school zelda tunes weve known and loved(they do but not alot of it, not to mention they changed the sound about).Alright lets get back to good stuffIf you want the same good ol\\' action adventure fun you had with Ocarina of time then be ready cause this game tops Ocarina with some of its awesome thoughtful Puzzles and Temples.  This Particular Zelda Game also features some really memorable Temples like the Ice Temple, Sand Temple ect.  One thing to be glad is that the water temple isn\\'t made to frustrate you and put you to full out angry mode like Ocarinas Water Temple.  Also did I mention this has some really amazing Boss Battles.  Sure there on the easy side(so was okami but they still proved to be epicly awesome and fun)but damn does this game feature some really fun and epic bosses that are truly unforgettable(like the Dragons Boss for example or the \"Shadow of the Colossus\" like Water Temple Boss).  But sadly the game does also have some very dull Bosses and one in particular really upsetted me which gets me back to a negative pointHOW THE HELL COULD YOU SCREW THIS PART UP NINTENDO?  Ocarina of Time has hands down in my opinion, the Greatest most epic Boss Finale I\\'ve ever played or witness.  From the battle itself to the damn scenery, its just flat out epic.  TP\\'s Finale Boss Battle just felt like 4 dumbed down short and easy boss battles with Ganondorf(I was really upset over the scenery aswell, just didn\\'t have that awesome epic feeling that Ocarina and many other games had)WHAT A HUGE LET DOWN.  This was really disappointing  Not to mention they used GANON as the first boss Phase, wth???!.The Good-One of the looking games on the GC, love the artistic, realistic dark look to it-Controls are tight and responsive as ever-Lots of Things to do which will expand your hours of play time-The Longest Zelda game ever...or..yet..should take a good 30 to beat the main game.-Some really epic Boss Battles-Some Temples are really amazing(some sadly not)-Some of the new things added like Being Wolf, Controlling a one eye Twilight Dragon beast in certain parts of the game are fun as well-Midna is KEWLThe Bad-Some Jaggies-Starts to loose its fun and edge near the 6th temple of the game-Worse Zelda game in terms of Music(man I really disliked the music in this game..specially the annoying voice to what was acctually a good tune..and im speaking of the Sky Temple..which was one of a few that were good...same with Twilight Temple which was really good too.-Some Bosses stinked...badly...Specifically the final boss-I really hated the way this game ended...It had a \"TILL NEXT TIME\" feeling to it...Heck the games final cutscene is shorter then any cutscene in the dame game!!!..What gives..-Gets abit repetitive at parts like the Wolf fetch quests in the Twilight WorldOverall this is a must get game for any cube owners and Zelda fans(duhhh).It may not be the best zelda game in the series but damn is it still good and fun, though its a shame Nintendo couldn\\'t have added or make totally new different things(other then the wolf aspects of the game)to make the so much more better(not to mention FIX some things they made in the game).  But Thats made up of the Amazing atmosphere that the game presents you with...But what they do add still makes up for half of its flaws...Overall this is one of the best games to come out in late 06 and should be played by everyone who is a fan of games in generalOverall4.5 out of 5',\n",

With games like Wario Ware: Smooth Moves and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (both of which take great advantage of the Wii Remote), this game comes off as too simple and just not as innovative as Nintendo boasts.Like it's cousin, Wii Sports, Wii Play is nothing more than a small demo of the Wiii's capability.  Shooting Range is an ok game with an amusing allusion to Duck Hunt (kinda wish it WAS an updated Duck Hunt), but it's too short.  Billiards is way too clumsy and tedious.  The ping-pong game is just horrendous!  Stick with Wii Sports: Tennis.  Pose Mii is completely ridiculous.  The only good games are Laser Hockey and Tanks.  Those are the only two I can see myself playing over and over.  Also, the graphics on this game aren't bad.The only saving grace of this package is the bundled Wii Remote.  Since they're still hard to find, it's comforting to know that at least you get a game.  I have to remind myself that I'm really paying $10 and not $50 for Wii Play.\",\n",

Unfortunately it really isn't the only way to control on the Wii. The nunchuck controller is a key add-on for movement on analog control on games like The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess, Red Steel for the Nunchuck fighting action, and the high-flying football tossing when it comes to playing with the New York Giants on Madden '07. The downside is that I honestly don't know why it has to be a sepearate accessory to the standard Wii controller, instead of being a part of the full controller.

Although the most popular one is Mario, there are ones who continued to be as surprising. The Legend Of Zelda is no acception. The epic game series featuring Link has redefined what epic games should be. Although that also could be said with new video game systems as well. For Nintendo, they wanted to break it wide open with their new console, the Wii. But, with a new system, can Link and his new quest deliver on the Wii, the same way Zelda games have thrived before like Ocarina Of Time delivered? Here is the review.The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess for the Nintendo Wii, is a wild and outrageous epic that shines brighter than any Nintendo game released in a long time. The objective of the game is simple, Link is back and he is learning his way through another quest, when during one split second, he is transformed into a wild wolf. Along the way, he has to battle shadow demons and reclaim the light that once thrived in Hyrule which was stolen by the vile Ganondorf. The graphics for the game are breathtaking, just like the edition for the Gamecube, and the feeling of the music thives with each portion of the game from the Forest Temple to the Baron Woods. The control is a bit tricky for new Wii gamers, but it is very simple to pick up, after a bit of practice, especially with the shooting with the slingshot, and the way you move the Wii controller.All in all, I was very impressed with The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It is definitely one of the most outrageous games ever released in a long while, but for anybody who is a die hard fan of the series, it is definitely worth it. I definitely recommened this for anyone who has the Wii, or wants the new Nintendo system. It is worth the money, and the tri-force that is with you.Graphics: ASound: AControl: BFun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+',\n",

Although more of the emphasis has been around the Wii, and the redesigned Nintendo DS Lite, the other systems still showed they had some light around for die hard gamers. That has been the case with great games like Need For Speed: Carbon, Madden '07, and especially the return of Link. Since the last major Zelda epic came out for the Gamecube a few years ago on The Wind Waker, eager Gamecube fans have wanted more. Twilight Princess made a smashing stand for the Wii as the premire launch title. Thankfully, Gamecube owners don't feel left out this time.The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess has been a long time coming for the Nintendo Gamecube. It has been a long time coming but it was worth it. The gameplay follows Link as he goes on a journey, trying to battle the fierce Ganondorf who has caused trouble around Hyrule. In the story, Link is transformed into a howling wolf, and uncovers the mystery of the twilight. The gameplay and the storyline are absolutely gorgeous, and the surroundings are absolutely filled with life. The control is also a bit easier to pickup for Gamecube, compared to the Wii, where it is more about accuracy from the controller. There is one main disadvantage with Twilight Princess for the Gamecube, compared to the Wii version. The maps and levels are all mirrored to seperate the two versions from one another. In other words, if you had to go left to a certain point on the Wii, Gamecube players would have to go right, which to Gamecube edition owners might find a bit confusing if they've bought the strategy guide Nintendo made.Despite that one big difference, The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess marks the near end of the Gamecube era, but it remains one must buy for die hard Zelda fans that is worth the effort. If you own a Gamecube, or the Wii, and you can't find the Wii edition, than I definitely recommend the Gamecube version. This is one that the tri-force is behind Link for eternity.Graphics: ASound: B+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B+\",\n",

The motion sensored remote controls may seem gimmicky at first, and even hard to get a hold of for some, but once you get the hang of it, you\\'ll be immersed in some of the most intuitive gaming unlike anything else you\\'ve experienced.  And unlike the PS3, the Wii features a bevy of excellent launch titles, and many of them are exclusive to the system.  The Wii includes Wii Sports, which is a great showcase for just what this system is capable of.  The game itself is a nice distraction and a taste of things to come for the system.  Yeah, the graphics aren\\'t mouthwatering like what you see on the XBox 360 or Playstation 3, and it doesn\\'t have all the bells and whistles that the other systems have either, but it\\'s the games that make the system worth owning.  The Wii is compatiable with Gamecube games and controlers, plus it also features the ability to go online to the Wii\\'s \"Virtual Console\" and download classic NES, Super NES, and Nintendo 64 games, as well as Genesis and Turbo-Grafx 16 titles; which in itself is an awesome extra that may rival that of XBox Live Arcade, maybe.  The list of first party games are great, including Excite Truck and of course Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and third party titles like Rayman Raving Rabbids, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Call of Duty 3, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, and Madden \\'07 all fit in quite well on the Wii.  Upcoming titles like Super Mario Galaxy and the next installment in the Metroid Prime series, make purchasing the Wii all the sweeter, and the ultra affordable price should help seal the deal.  Yes, some people won\\'t get the controls, and many may be turned off by the lack of mature games, but for what it\\'s worth, the Wii is the best thing Nintendo has crafted in a while.  All in all, if you\\'re looking for a next-gen system with a ton of potential, the Wii is a glimpse at what the future of gaming could be.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"The Nintendo Gamecube came out around 11/10-19/01 and from it's begining to this very day, it is considered as a child's system. They're partially right: About 60% of the videogames coming out are Teen & Mature rated,& only a fraction of them ever reach the 'cube (restating the fact that this is for mostly kids.)The console does pass at an 80% though. The graphics on Nintendo's latest console are better than ever, but Sony & Microsoft are still in the lead. The design of the Gamecube is.... well, a cube (duh). Compared with the PS2 and Xbox, it's the most compact of them all(mabey not the slim PS2), so you can set it up almost anywhere. If you're a die-hard Nintendo freak, then this for you.Anyone else may lose interest very quickly and buy another, different console, but keep reading.As I said in the begining, the graphics could be improved, but  about 100 of the games have stellar graphics.The controller, in my opinion, is the most comfortable for your hands than the other big-boy consoles. It dosen't have a kajillion buttons like it's underling, the N64.Also it is smaller than Xbox's mammoth controller. It sports 4 buttons, 3 shoulders, a joystick, control pad, and a camara changing c-stick.The games are mostly 1st party games(games made by their console company) with some big name multi-console games. Nintendo sticks to it's roots with its original titles, like Mario(mostly for kids), Donky Kong(party game/kid game), which uses bongos instead of a controller, Metroid(for teens and adults), and my favorite: The Legend of Zelda(for kids and teens and adults). Then some other games like Resident Evil 4, the NBA live series, and Prince of Persia.I'd say try the cube at a friends house, if you like it, buy it, or try the other consoles, you will find one you like. If you thinking of getting this one, here are some recomindations, you'll be satisfied: Mario Sunshine, Paper Mario 2, Metroid Prime 1&2, Zelda Wind Waker & Twilight Princess, Resident Evil 4, Prince of Persia, and Super Smash Bros.

The Wind Waker HD doesn't add any uniqueness , rather trying desperately to satisfy the die-hard fans of OOT, by creating the same puzzle ideas, same weapons, same bosses strategies and same nemesis, the only special touch of wind waker is the concept of sailing, and this is not totally great, unless you enjoy getting lost in the seas and sailing for a very long time to reach a destination, you will find your self strayed and not aware of your objective, you simply reach to a point to ask your self, what is next? where should I go and what should I do? and this eventually will drive you to get bored of the game and thinking it's pointless and may want to refer to a walkthrough at most time.I know the legend of Zelda is better than that, but maybe my problem is I didn't play the gamecube version, and actually experienced The Wind Waker after Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess, which both were legendary.I think The Wind Waker should be a game of its own, but the biggest dislike here is why are you trying to imitate ocarina of time? move on, create a game with special ideas, and let us experience a matchless Legend Of Zelda,\",\n",

And with everyone saying this was the best Zelda game ever, reminding me of the time everyone was saying Ocarina of Time was the best Zelda game ever I was nervous to buy LoZ:TP because of there was a possiblity this game was over-rated like Ocarina of Time and it was.If you want to learn the background of the story then look at other reviews or read Amazon's summary because the plot is too long for me to explain.This game is great; graphics are amazing, the plot was easy to follow and the game was fun to play. And don't forget it's easy, really really really easy. Too easy for my taste. I love a challenge, I like games that make players have to use logic in order to progress in the game. But unlike other Zelda games I played where I'll get stuck multiple times, I only got stuck in Twilight Princess two times; at the Water Temple and Mansion dungeon. Other than that the game was a breeze, the dungeons aren't that hard (don't get me started on the last fungeon: being that easy should be a crime), and the bosses were push overs. Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages was harder than this game.The majority of the items that I had were useless. By useless I mean once you get that certain item in the dungeon and after you're done you'll NEVER use that item again.The other thing I don't like about the game is they focus the plot too much on Midna (instead of the annoying fairy following you around you got an annoying bossy imp) and Zant (the villian of the story). I mean this is the Legend of Zelda; give Link, Zelda, or Ganon more cutscenes.There were times this game felt like a chore; like finding bugs, collecting all those fragments Midna wanted then having it taken away from you just after you're done collecting it, then finding all these mirror pieces.It is a good game but people are giving it too much credit\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Just like many other reviewers state the fact that they have been long time Zelda fans, I have also been a long time fan of the Zelda franchise for over 11 years, starting with the critically acclaimed Ocarina of Time title and have played nearly every Zelda game in the series from the original NES Zelda to Twilight Princess, and while I do like this game, I found the motion controls to be frustrating to say the least. Half the time when I swing the Wii Motion Plus remote one way, the sword either does not respond, or swings a different direction instead. Never once have I encountered such a frustrating problem with Nintendo\\'s games, and I found the steps to configure the Wii Motion Plus remote to be very excessive just to play one game. If it asked for the remote to be configured once, and never have to do that again would be one thing, but of course that is not nearly as frustrating as having to consistently center the remote during gameplay when using the Beetle or dowsing tools.Yes, I understand that the above criticisms may be trivial to many, but I cannot see myself enjoying the game completely if I must spend half the time trying to correct technical errors that come across either from the lack of recognition when swinging the sword one direction, or the perception of the center being broken when using either the Beetle or the Dowsing tools. Sure, many people can prove that it works, but it is not always the case. I have also seen comments in reviews that disapprove of these types of reviews, but please do NOT misunderstand. I do not hate or even dislike this game by any means, I would certainly not take it to the extreme of being the \"worst\" Zelda game, because there are redeeming qualities such as save statues being conveniently placed after certain points, making it easy to return to that particular location when shutting off the game as opposed to starting from the entrance of the dungeon and being given a head start with six hearts, as opposed to the standard three.  I will say, however that one of my other minor gripes are that the main villain does not seem as intimidating as I would like for him to be, but of course that is merely a minor gripe, nothing to be incredibly disappointed about. One thing that bothers me, however are the rather disposable nature of the shields offered in the game. I cannot myself completely enjoying a Zelda game where you must either repair or replace your shields when they are hit enough.The story, of course is quite different from the other games, which I must bestow credit for, since a chance of pace once in a while is desirable.If one had curiosity about how the legend has begun, this game answers it, so that definitely settles the uncertainty of it. Overall, while I do exhibit great frustration over motion controls, having to constantly reconfigure it, and being greeted with a couple of \"Game Over\" screens due to the lack of response from the Wii Motion Plus remote I would still recommend trying this game for a different experience. I may not like this game as much as the earlier entries in the series, but it does have some redeeming qualities here and there, and Nintendo at least tried to provide a different experience, even though it could have been done better. I understand that many will strongly disagree with this review, but I am merely throwing my two cents in, and I apologize if I have offended any of my fellow Zelda fans in advance, and have a great day.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I loved the Wii when it came out. That was because I was 8 and it was the only game system I had ever seen besides Playstation 2. Now I am older and own almost every major system. The Wii has a lot of good games... but something is missing. Not very many games are coming out. Nintendo has released game after game, but that is happening way too slow. I don't blame Nintendo at this point. They are busy trying to get 3DS sales up and are preparing to launch the brand new Wii-u console. But the system has been around for 5 years, so you would think that it would a lot of variety. No. The Gamecube went perfect for me. Every Nintendo game was innovated and put to the maximum. The Wii? Well, Mario got innovated but the rest of the franchises I loved seemed to die here. No Starfox, The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess was kind of boring and did not really impress me the way Wind Waker did, and I have yet to see a Yoshi Island, Final Fantasy, or Pikmin game (besides the Gamecube port). Soon I find that all I use my Wii for is the handy Virtual Console service so I can play old classics. Then I bought a NES, SNES, N64, and Genesis. Now what? It only gets played by my brother, who is only 9. I play it when people come over, but that is about it. It has a lot of good things as well. The motion control is awesome. It is much better then Kinect. A lot of games can give you a good workout. It is built like a rock, mine has survived 5 years and still works. The virtual console service is the best part. Download all the classics and play them like it is still the middle of the 1990s. The graphics aren't the best, but who cares? While the Wii has provided fun, it is becoming a little old and you might as well wait for the new Wii-u. The Gamecube is far better and cheaper, it was about 20-50 dollars for everything I needed. The Playstation 3 feels more modern and neater if you are willing to spend more cash. I have loved every Nintendo system, but I can not help but feel dissapointed on this one.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Legend of Zelda games were defining moments for me growing up. Discovering the original NES game, spending months with ocarina songs in my head, and the pitch-perfect story of Twilight Princess. In fact, I still wrestle with the idea of getting a tri-force tattoo on a regular basis. The first couple hours of this game triggered all those memories and hands-down the thing that tugs at my heart strings the most: the sound design. Every little sound that\\'s been carried through each incarnation makes me indescribably happy. That\\'s why it\\'s almost painful to admit that Skyward Sword was only an average game when compared to the rest.Two-thirds of the game can be described as a fetch quest. This painful aspect comes in the form of, \"Oh you\\'ve collected A, B and C? Now you can collect D, E and F!\" However the best example I can give- at a certain point you must gather a piece of song from a forest god. You talk to this person, they recognize that you were sent from the Goddess herself (thus, the Creator has vouched for Link\\'s journey) but still they feel the need to test you and scatter twenty objects across the land. Those objects don\\'t add up to a new weapon or heart piece, they\\'re just a pointless exercise to waste your time. This can be summed up saying that I rarely felt like any of these missions directly related to my final goal.Most locations have rather clever design and throughout the game they keep it interesting by transforming the landscape. However, in the more detailed temples I\\'m never given context for the design or past importance of these areas. Previous Zelda games had unique tribes living in each area that would give you the history of the land. However Skyward Sword takes place in a land that\\'s been vacant for a very long time. Literally and figuratively it robs the game of life, story and a level of subtext that, in previous games, gave reason and purpose to each new land. The only constant resident here is your new guide, Fi, who is annoying as ever, even more so than Navi. She will state the obvious, \"this door appears to be blocked by a gate,\" and chime at you each time you should change the batteries in your Wii-mote.My biggest gripe however is that I was expecting something new in the way that Twilight Princess accomplished. I had high hopes that as Zelda takes out on her own journey early on, that she might rise up and become a hero as well. They position Zelda and Link as two heroes on the same journey, just on different sides. As such I was excited to see Zelda channeling the powers of the Goddess so that they would literally be fighting side-by-side in the end. No such luck, even with all the powers of creation inside her, she\\'s relegated to a damsel-in-distress that is either on the sidelines or needs to be rescued. It\\'s been said before but when Zelda is constantly dismissed in this way, it begs the question of how it became known as the Legend of \"Zelda.\" This game was an opportunity to finally make this her story and it completely dropped the ball.The good aspects of this game are everything you most likely already know. The sound design is some of the best in videogame history. The clawshot, bow, Master Sword and even a few new clever devices. A vital part of the story always worth telling is the underlying mythos of the tri-force and Link/Zelda. One of my favorite things about this franchise is that they essentially tell this story for each game but every time they add something new to the mix. This game does so, but only in a vague way by lightly hinting that the struggle is cyclical. Trying to tie the stories together isn\\'t necessary, after this long we\\'ve come to accept that each Zelda game is an alternate version of the same story.The game is not all bad, in fact it\\'s still better than the majority of the games out there. My level of comparison for this game is based on past Zelda games and what I expect out of this franchise. I\\'m not comparing it to other AAA titles and I\\'m far more in favor of an adventure game such as this as opposed to an ultra-violent space marine shooter. So if you\\'re a huge Zelda fan it\\'s still worth picking up (it clocks in at 40hrs) but you\\'re also not missing out by skipping this one.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Don\\'t get me wrong; I LOVE the Legend Of Zelda series and readily admit that it is the BEST series Nintendo has.  But that also means that the standards are pretty high.  I admit that I played Skyward Sword before this one, which may have influenced my opinion for the sake that Skyward Sword just feels so natural and smooth to play.  Skyward Sword is a true motion control game; Twilight Princess is not.  If you want to see what I mean, go to the end of the review.  Otherwise:Let\\'s start with the good--The storyline follows the same pattern of virtually every Zelda game made since Ocarina of Time:  A few early dungeons to collect some items to stand up to the evil that threatens the land; once you have acquired them you find out that they just won\\'t be enough.  So you embark on the quest to try to find the other items, and so on and so forth.  Considering that they have used this basic outline over and over again, you would think it would get stale.  But honestly, it just doesn\\'t.  This strategy adds a lot of length to the game, so you don\\'t notice that the skeleton is pretty much the same, especially because the layout of Hyrule is not exactly the same in every game.  You\\'ll spend a good amount of time riding around and discovering new shortcuts from place to place.The dungeons get a PERFECT score for difficulty.  The puzzles here are not cookie-cutter and if you want to solve them in anything less than an hour you have to observe, not just look around.  Obviously for some you will need certain items, that\\'s just the way it\\'s always been done.  But there were some that I had to do over again: these challenges actually expanded as I came back to them again--excellent design because they were harder the second time around.The wolf transformation adds a nice dynamic to the game and is blended perfectly into the game.  There will be times when you need to be the wolf, but they won\\'t be so overwhelming that you will get annoyed.The music is... well, Nintendo has taken quite a while to get on the symphony-music bandwagon.  All midis here, which can actually get a little annoyingThe side quests are a little annoying as well, to be perfectly honest.  The main example is one where you are escorting a wagon to a village to protect it from attackers as it goes.  Instead of doing what real intelligent beings would do and just go as quickly as possible the game has the wagon go around in circles until you\\'ve defeated a certain enemy.  If you don\\'t defeat that enemy, you have to follow the wagon in the same futile circle until you\\'ve defeated that enemy which is when you have to move on to yet another futile circle.  And because this side quest was necessary to the storyline of the game, you can\\'t get out of it...Combat leaves a lot to be desired, especially the bosses.  Their movements were very predictable, and instead of attacking all the time, most of the bosses just sat there and only attacked occasionally.  Basically, all you have to do is find out their patterns and take them out like so.  That\\'s fine for a dungeon puzzle, but when you\\'re in combat you get the most thrill as the game comes closer to a real fight.  The game tries to compensate for that by teaching you certain combo attacks as you go, but it\\'s just not the same.  You swing your remote, but to do a truly satisfying attack you have to do some button combos at the same time--not at all like a real fight.Which brings me to the main criticism of the game.  I say it would have been better on GameCube because billing this version of the game as \\'motion control\\' gaming is deceptive.  Example:  When playing, swing the remote horizontally and Link swings his sword horizontally; swing the remote vertically, and Link swings his sword HORIZONTALLY; thrust the remote forward to stab, and Link swings his sword HORIZONTALLY.  All the game is doing is triggering an algorithm, something along the lines of \"If the remote beam moves this many pixels, swing the sword,\" but leaves out the direction of the swing.  If you want to do things like stab or swing vertically you have to combine some buttons to the mix, which makes it feel more like an arcade fighter game than a smooth, motion control game where your character\\'s movements actually follow your own.  That fact annoyed me the most when trying to fight, and in all honesty it made fighting quite a bit harder, especially when the enemy has one particular weak spot which you have to hit just right, but can\\'t because the game doesn\\'t have the programming to let you put the sword exactly where you want to on the first strike.  It\\'s honestly like having a car that turns left when you turn the wheel left, but turns left when you turn the wheel right.This game does have a lot going for it... on the GameCube.  From the major glitches of the fighting it is obvious to tell that this was intended to be a GameCube game, but was then rushed to be available on the Wii.  The only advantage that this gave the game was allowing you to swing your sword while running--great to cut grass quickly and wipe out larger numbers of smaller enemies.  If it weren\\'t for the controller problems this game would be about as close to perfect as it could be:  lots of gameplay, challenging dungeons, entertaining and complex characters, and a massive world that begs to be explored.  But you get all of that on the GameCube version, too, without the headache of having controls that don\\'t always do what they are billed as doing.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword released with great fanfare.  Here, at the last moments of the Wii\\'s life before the Wii U arrives, Nintendo has unleashed what they consider the system\\'s magnum opus.  And does it live up to the hype?  Well...yes and no.  Let me get this out of the way:  Skyward Sword gets a lot of things right...but it\\'s FAR from perfect.  Is it the best Zelda game in existence?  Absolutely, unequivocally no!  Not even close.  I know this opinion differs from the norm, and I apologize to Zelda fanatics everywhere.  But I simply couldn\\'t give this game the free pass that most critics happily bestowed upon it.I\\'ll start with what the game did well.  First and foremost...the story.  This is the most story-driven Zelda game ever, and it presents it in the most charming and beautiful way possible.  Bright, cel-shaded, picturesque graphics are used to tell and equally beautiful story (goodness...if the Wii could display in HD this would be the best-looking game of the year).  The game begins by introducing us to the main characters in their home in the sky, Skyloft.  Link and Zelda are schoolmates.  Zelda herself is given a huge role here, and we genuinely end up caring for her and Link\\'s relationship.  In the brief time that we see them interact together, Nintendo managed to make a lasting impression of its two main characters that remains throughout the game\\'s entire 50+ hours.  The school bully, Groose, is also a hoot (whose role later in the game is pretty cool).  Once tragedy strikes and the main story begins, we\\'re introduced to Fi, a robotically-inclined personification of Link\\'s Master Sword (more on her later).  Then, there\\'s Ghirahim, the main villain.  Nintendo has clearly outdone themselves with this character.  He\\'s creepy, maniacal, and very well-written.  The entire tale is accompanied by what is possibly the best soundtrack to any Zelda game I\\'ve heard.  This goes double for the handful of melodies that are fully-orchestrated.  The game\\'s ending is simply fantastic, solidifying the fact that Skyward Sword is an origin story and setting the stage for the fifteen Zelda games that follow it chronologically.  Also, Skyward Sword has the best variety of special items of any Zelda game.  The beetle, the bellows, the whip...all new additions that are a blast to use!Where the game falters is in pretty much every other aspect.  As far as content, Skyward Sword is extremely anemic.  Unlike superior Zelda titles, there are only three areas in Skyward Sword, and you must go to them over and over.  Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano and Lanayru Desert.  That\\'s it.  You will become intimately familiar with these areas (as well as Skyloft, which is the hub world).  Not sure why Nintendo skimped on environments.  The sky is littered with a few floating islands in addition to Skyloft, but they\\'re literally tiny fragments that may contain a treasure chest or two.  The rest is just vast empty sky, similar to the empty oceans in The Wind Waker.  Compare this to the vast open worlds of Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword is pretty substandard.  There\\'s also an alchemy component and item-crafting aspect to Skyward Sword.  The world is littered with random loot, which can be used to upgrade shields and other items.  There\\'s also a variety of bugs that can be caught, and added to potions to give them different abilities.  Despite how cool that sounds, it all turns out to be rather pointless and has a \"tacked on\" feel to the game as a whole.  You don\\'t really NEED the upgrades, and if you do get them, the level of improvement isn\\'t that big.Another major aspect of this game is the much-lauded motion controls.  Skyward Sword requires the Wii Motion Plus, which the game utilizes to an utterly absurd degree.  To say this game has overdependence on motion controls is the understatement of the year.  The game IS motion controls.  I\\'ve heard many people ask, \"Why couldn\\'t they add an option to play with the Classic Controller?\"  The truth is that without motion controls, Skyward Sword would be half a game, at best.  The huge majority of the enemies are designed around precisely striking specific areas, and just frantically waving the Wii remote around will result in repeated blocks by your foes.  Boss fights, too, require precise swinging or stabbing.  Flying around the sky requires tilting the remote or \"flapping\" it like it was your wings.  Playing the musical instrument du jour (the Goddess Harp) requires you to wave your remote rhythmically as if you were strumming a harp.  Swimming is also done by tilting the Wii remote.  This is all well and good...and to be fair, the motion controls are fairly precise most of the time.  But no matter how precise they are, they\\'re not more convenient than, nor as precise as, pressing buttons or using an analog stick.  I found the motion controls lost their novelty fairly quickly, and in many cases I found them a nuisance.  Also, the remote was sometimes a bit too sensitive, and reeling my sword back usually resulted in a strike from the opposite direction that I intended...and of course the enemy changed its stance as a result.  I get why Nintendo went this direction, but I feel like it just got in the way.  They should\\'ve concentrated more on variety of environments than motion controls.  The harp in particular is pretty curious.  Since they wanted you to use motion controls, playing a song only requires that you wave back and forth.  Gone is the more intuitive approach of having you press buttons or directions to play a specific melody...instead the game decides what to play depending on the mission at hand.Then there\\'s Fi, your guide throughout the game.  If you thought Navi from Ocarina of Time was annoying, get ready to redefine your criteria.  Fi pops up for the tiniest of reasons merely to state things that are EXTREMELY obvious.  There was a moment where I entered a room and the camera pans to a treasure chest containing the boss key (they come in a bigger, more ornate treasure chest).  Once the camera went back to Link, Fi pops out and says, \"Link!  I have some important information you will want to hear!  There is a treasure chest in this room!  There is an 80% chance it will contain the key!\"  Or another example:  Link is in a pirate ship, and suddenly giant tentacles rip through the ship in front of you.  Fi pops out with, \"Link!  I calculate a 90% chance that there is a giant monster outside.  I recommend going outside to investigate!\"  It is completely infuriating sometimes since she breaks up the gameplay so often.  It\\'s like Nintendo is terrified at the prospect of having players figure things out on their own.So there you have it.  Great story, amazing music, awesome items, all mixed with unnecessarily intrusive controls and a world map that would feel limited on a handheld iteration of Zelda, let alone a full console release.  Yes, this is one of the best titles on the Wii, and despite its problems it should be played if you\\'re a Zelda fan.  But in my humble opinion, it fails to improve on the Zelda formula on most fronts, and in the end I rank it as one of the more mediocre Zelda games.',\n",

The thing is that that is disappointing considering that Nintendo used to be a primarily hardcore oriented platform, but for everyone else, you are assured a great time.  Motion controls, especially with the wii remote plus, are pretty spot-on.  They're certainly more accurate than what is found with the Kinect, but nowhere near as 1:1 accurate or precise as the move.

Wii overview: Virtual Console, Wiiware, internet browser, everybody votes, check mii out, (the 3 following games are the only decent titles with Wii motion plus support) Wii Sports: Resort, Red Steel 2, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword & Twilight Princess, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Epic Mickey, No More Heroes 1 & 2, Zack & Wicki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure, Madworld, Sin & Punishment 2, Metroid Prime: Trilogy, Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 (the first Super Mario Galaxy may just be the best game ever made), (the rest of this list has online multiplayer) Call of Duty: World at War, Modern Warfare, & Black Ops, Boom Blox 1 & 2, Super Smash Bos.

I did get to experience Monster Hunter Tri, Metroid Prime:  Trilogy, and Super Mario Galaxies 1 & 2 so that's a definite bonus, but the 360 and especially the PS3 have much better libraries suited for hardcore gamers, especially those that want good online experiences.

It is just how I perceive the overall feeling of this game.I was very excited to play this game when screen captures started showing up in gaming magazines in the months leading up to its release. Those pics prove the art design is great.  But, seeing the game in motion is another story. The game lacks a lot of polish. Animations are clunky and frequent slow downs give the game a \"still in beta testing\" vibe. This sucks some of the life out of what should have been a \"can\\'t miss\" adventure game.The back of the box claims the game is an RPG adventure.  It would be more accurate to say it is an RPG lite adventure.  You earn experience through how you react to various situations.  Your reactions will earn you favor with one of four different gods to power up your character.  Each area in the game is divided into combat and a bunch of RPG-style fetch quests.  I found myself running around doing said fetch quests, more often than fighting off monsters.  The story is interesting enough to tie it all together.The game takes rather uncreative liberties with Greece myths. The basic framework of the myths you are familiar with is there. It is just that the designers flattened out the details to make the background myths feel bland.None the less.  If you like greek mythology, then give Rise of the Argonauts a try.  It is easy to overlook the game\\'s shortcomings.  It is a great game with some sub-par production value issues.  I suggest renting this game more than buying it.',\n",

This would be purely embarrassing to everyone as you muddled your way through the crowd, attempted to make small talk, and eventually left with your tail between your legs.  It would be a very difficult night to rebound from as your social standings would plummet.  Does it sound like these first few sentences are coming from personal experience?  Is this my attempt to reach out to anyone who feels my pain?  Is this a journal entry slipped into a review?  Nope, this is how I chose to open my thoughts for the newest Wii game entitled \"Super Mario Party 8\".  After stumbling across a random Wii at a local big-box store, I took the cheap dive (while everyone was paying top dollar via auction sites) and a month later eventually took it out of the box.  I built some Mii characters, I played my tennis, but overall I was searching for something a bit more substantial.  I wanted to \"thwack\" my controller around while learning why the Wii is the most sought after system today.  So, I picked up \"Super Mario Party 8\", and allowed the adventures to begin over the course of the next four hours - until I subsequently returned it for \"Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\".Now, before everyone huffs and puffs about not playing or introducing myself to this world of \"Super Mario Party\", I must admit, this was my first.  I was hoping for the same mad-cap chaos that was allowed when friends gathered to play \"Warioware: Smooth Moves\", but alas it didn\\'t happen.  Again, I would like to state that I have never picked up the other games, thus already biasing my opinion of this game, but I would still like to make my thoughts aware in case there are others like me that were thinking one thing, but were handed another.  Let me begin by saying, this is a multi-player game.  While it may boast a strong individual story, there is nothing of the sort.  The individual game is about four hours long, the AI for the computer is non-creative, and when the big battle finally occurs - you have all the chances in the world to see the uncreative ending.  I expected more from a flagship enterprise that Nintendo has created with its Mario-esque characters.  If I had no friends, I still wanted the game to sustain itself.  My friends aren\\'t buying the game - I am, therefore it needs to initially appeal to me.  Am I wrong with this thought?I would also like to admit that I like the concept of board game play.  I am a single Monopoly player at heart, and so this really appealed to me, but it just didn\\'t hold the bond.  You have little to no control over your character.  The physical \"game town\" within the game is small and after about three hours of wandering around, you fell as if you just need to get out of dodge.  The game-master is annoying and verbose.  From the moment you turn the system on (whether your first time or your fifty-th), he walks you through the process like you are in third grade.  Sure, you can move quickly though his speeches, but they just get old over time.  That was my overall pain with this game, the lack of originality.  Over the course of about three hours, it did become old.  I played as Wario and hoped that he would be slippery, slimy, and overall mischievous in his ability to work the boards, but that didn\\'t happen.  It wouldn\\'t matter who you played, they would all do the same, react similarly, with no special events or opportunities.  I wanted side stories, capers, and tricks as we battled our way to the top board, but again, that never happened.  Unlike \"Warioware\", there wasn\\'t hours of game play.  The inconsistency of the boards made some games easy, others mediocre hard, there wasn\\'t the quick progression of standards.  The final board was exciting just because it provided something new, but it forced the gamer to ask, \"Why wasn\\'t this thought process used throughout the game?\"This is a game.  This is a game for those that need to play a board game without actually having to pick up the pieces.  I have no problems with the board game aspect of this video game, what my issues translate into deal with the fact that we live in 2007 (soon to be 2008), with major advances in the gaming industry, but \"Super Mario Party 8\" could easily have been made in the the late 90s.  The graphics for \"Super Mario Party 8\" rank, at best, in the mid-6s.  I hated not being able to control my characters and being forced to go in a certain direction.  The game play became stale, even with friends, after about two hours.  I can\\'t say that this game, \"Super Mario Party 8\" is the best representation of what the Nintendo Wii is capable of.  I wasn\\'t impressed - and with that in mind, let the negative \"helpfulness\" meter reign supreme.Grade: ** out of *****',\n",

Nyko, which has made some previous lackluster controllers for Nintendo products before has tried it again, with their Wireless Sensor Bar. It is easy to setup and connect with the Wii. Unfortunately, there has been a huge problem with the gameplay. At times, whenever I'm playing a game like The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess, my Wii controller stops working, and I have to change the batteries, and it affects the gameplay constantly. To be honest with you, I think Nintendo can make a better wireless sensor bar than this one.

       "   'reviewText': 'The Nintendo Wii isn\\'t even two months old, yet many gamers including myself have gotten a grasp on which types of games play well and which ones don\\'t play so well. So far, the first-person shooter genre has been the target for a lot of controversy; some Wii gamers love stuff like Call of Duty 3 and Red Steel while others complain that the games are unplayable. I fall into the former category, and thus decided to give Ubisoft Montreal\\'s Wii iteration of the Far Cry series a shot. Far Cry: Vengeance has its ups and downs but altogether is the most playable Wii shooter yet.Far Cry: Vengeance won\\'t win you over with its story. Jack Carver gets caught up with a busty arms dealer named Kade who gets him into all sorts of trouble with a crazed madman named Semeru, his mercenaries, the military, and a man in charge named Kien Do. I\\'ve never really liked Carver, even in the series\\' 2004 PC debut. Vengeance does nothing to change that, with poorly constructed cinemas and the worst voice acting since...well, Elebits, which came out the same day. I\\'ll just say that December 12th, 2006 marked the day of all days for awful voice acting. As a result, I couldn\\'t find myself caring much about the story and just wanted to shoot some thugs in the jungle.Far Cry: Vengeance uses familiar Wii shooter mechanics but does everything better and smoother. Aiming around the screen works well and the aiming/turning \"box\" feels more natural here than in Red Steel or Call of Duty 3. Ubisoft Montreal added an extra helper by letting the player prevent the camera from turning by holding down the A button. This allows for super-precise aim and severely limits missed-shot frustrations. Jumping with the nunchuck (flick up) works well, and I personally think that reloading (C button) is much more natural than flicking (Red Steel) or pressing the super-small Minus button (Call of Duty 3). I can\\'t say enough how much more I enjoyed playing this game just because of its intuitive controls. Ubisoft Paris and Treyarch, grab some paper and take notesThere are definitely a lot of guys to shoot, too. I am somewhat disappointed, generally speaking, that Ubisoft Montreal went away from the original game\\'s stealth-centric style. This style, which forced the player to scope out an upcoming area with binoculars to pinpoint enemy locations and other points of interest, took more time but ultimately provided more depth. Far Cry: Vengeance is much more run-and-gun, which is still pretty fun, but admittedly shallow. As I said, there are a lot of mercs in the lengthy single-player campaign to shoot. There are also a lot of guns to use, like standard pistols and submachine guns as well as high-powered sniper rifles, chain guns, and rocket launchers. The guns are all pretty useful in their own unique ways; the pistol isn\\'t too weak and thus is handy throughout the game while the sniper rifle allows the player to stay back and pick off thugs from afar. You\\'ll also drive vehicles like ATVs, patrol boats, and licensed Jeep trucks (strange use of licensing, but whatever), but after a while I preferred to walk and shoot because the vehicles didn\\'t handle as easily as they should.Jack\\'s predator powers, which were made familiar in the Xbox release, Far Cry: Predator, are put to good use in Vengeance. By killing a lot of enemies and busting skulls with headshots, Jack will fill up a Predatorine meter that allows him to utilize some of his powers. Jack initially unlocks a super-fast running speed that can be activated by holding down the A button. He also has a health-regenerating power, done by flicking the nunchuck to the left and the right. This was obviously the most useful power throughout the game. Soon afterward, Jack will be jumping 20 feet into the air, using enhanced senses like sight and smell, and climbing up walls with his bare hands. The predator powers are all a lot of fun to use and open up the gameplay for more possibilities. For example, there\\'s a sequence about halfway through the game where a player is running across bridges and through the jungle surrounded by snipers. One could either take it slow and pick off the snipers with his or her own rifle or run and jump at mad speeds through the entire area to avoid their gunfire. I personally took the latter approach in this given situation 1) because I\\'m an awful sniper and 2) I was running low on health and didn\\'t have enough Predatorine to regenerate my health manually.Unfortunately, not all is smooth sailing. Despite my enjoyment of most of the game, I\\'ll gladly tell you that Far Cry: Vengeance looks like piss. It is easily the worst-looking \"next-gen\" game I\\'ve ever seen. Nintendo can walk the \"gameplay over graphics\" line all they want, but when visual factors look like they came from the Nintendo 64 (textures) or Dreamcast (character models) era, the line has been crossed. I\\'m really not being sarcastic, satirical, or unfair: this is a pretty awful-looking game. The frame rate doesn\\'t even hold up very well in some sequences, either. I\\'ve seen bugs like enemies walking into walls and tree bases floating three or four feet above the ground. What happened to the dynamic lighting and water effects, detailed character models, and pretty cinemas? What\\'s the deal, Ubisoft? The Wii is clearly capable of visuals that are better than this. Look at games like Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Rayman: Raving Rabbids, hell, even Red Steel  This is an embarrassment. Other than feats like an impressive amount of vegetation, large levels, and the fact that the game runs without freezing, there isn\\'t much to compliment. I\\'d have much rather had small levels with better graphics and effects.The sound effects aren\\'t much better, but they work. The music is appropriate for the surroundings, but I found it odd that intense jungle beats would sometimes play while I was simply strolling through the harmless jungle, far away from any sort of threat. And what\\'s with the insults? Ubisoft Paris threw shockers like \"Moron \" at me with Red Steel, and I\\'m still hearing \"Coward \" in Far Cry: Vengeance. What\\'s the deal? This is an M-Rated game made in 2006. I\\'m not asking for gracious, unnecessary amounts of derogatory swearing, but when a man is jumping 20 feet in the air towards me about to dice me up with a machine gun, the last thing I\\'m going to yell is, \"You are afraid of me \"There are a few factors that will ultimately determine whether or not you enjoy Far Cry: Vengeance. First, do you like how Wii shooters handle? Second, do you like run-and-gun shooters with little to no required strategy? Third, are visuals and sound effects important in any way, shape, or form? If you answered yes, yes, and no, you\\'ll agree with me when I say that Far Cry: Vengeance is an enjoyable game, if not a great game. Otherwise, you\\'ll say, \"This game plays as poorly as the others,\" \"This game is shallow and stupid,\" and \"This game looks like dog crap,\" respectively. Think about it clearly: Vengeance has great shooter mechanics and a fun campaign but almost totally lacks any impressive superficial values whatsoever.',\n",

Playing this game on the Nintendo GameCube, you'll notice one clear difference, the flawless amazing controls have now been replaced by the atrocious Wii Mote and Nunchuk controls.Aiming the Wii Mote at the screen to shoot enemies didn't enhance the gameplay, it made it needlessly more challenging and more annoying than it was in the GameCube version. Luckily however, unlike Twilight Princess you don't have to keep an onscreen fairy continually situated in the middle of the screen in order to maintain balance when moving, but experiencing this game on the Wii was a major disappointment regardless. I didn't like pointing the Wii Mote at the screen to shoot, if you don't point it perfectly at your target it'll miss them, and it's very easy to miss in this game. If you accidentally aim the gun too high, too low, too far to the left, or too far to the right of the screen, you have to struggle for a few seconds to get the laser pointing back to where you want it to be because there's a major lag when it gets stuck in one of the ends of the screen. Same thing with the fairy in Twilight Princess.Another annoying thing was having to slice with the knife and just like in the GameCube version it's extremely delayed and goes in the exact same slicing motion over and over. You'd think the Wii version would have fixed this problem and made the slice go in the direction of your choosing, but of course they fixed absolutely nothing and you'd have to be as naive as I was to think they did.The worst part of all was the cut-scenes which required you to move the Wii Mote, Nunchuk, or press a button with perfect timing in order to survive. This task was challenging in the GameCube version and something they could've fixed with this version, but instead, this was nearly impossible to pull off and I died way more often in this version than the other one.Resident Evil 4 is considered to be one of if not the best Resident Evil game and that's definitely true for the GameCube version, but the Wii version is awful.The new mini-games and new story for Ada are so lame and stupid and repetitive. Nothing new was added to this game from the GameCube version. All they did was put in some rehashed elements from the main story and changed them slightly for a new side quest starring Ada. Lame and not worth playing.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it\\'s hard to believe I\\'m even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn\\'t live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn\\'t do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I\\'m not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don\\'t tell me Nintendo wasn\\'t riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it\\'s basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you\\'ll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that\\'s it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it\\'s almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I\\'m really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that\\'s apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I don\\'t care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn\\'t much to admire. I don\\'t really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64\\'s datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we\\'re forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I\\'d be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn\\'t. This isn\\'t even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I\\'ll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.Let\\'s discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it\\'s almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you\\'re doing and where you\\'re going, it\\'s enough to make you think you\\'re playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It\\'s never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It\\'s mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron\\'s for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn\\'t even feel or look like you\\'re going 7 years into the future as Link\\'s appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn\\'t appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he\\'s slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it\\'s very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won\\'t get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I\\'m stuck in a maze and I can\\'t get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren\\'t any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda\\'s so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It\\'s all about atmosphere. It\\'s all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo\\'s most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That\\'s exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn\\'t stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64\\'s limitations as a console that it\\'s unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it\\'s more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you\\'re running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead\\'s let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you\\'re trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you\\'re stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it\\'s best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They\\'re really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I\\'ve ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don\\'t feel like collecting them, then don\\'t- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you\\'re wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it\\'s probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it\\'s really fun and creative. The hookshot\\'s basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it\\'s annoying that it\\'s used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you haven\\'t noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It\\'s overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don\\'t make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I\\'ve ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon\\'s castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It\\'s supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim\\'s battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It\\'s really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It\\'s better than most fishing games I\\'ve played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That\\'s a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don\\'t really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you\\'ll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you\\'re dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what\\'s available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It\\'s because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that\\'s really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn\\'t fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn\\'t get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon\\'s presented uninterestingly. You\\'re *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn\\'t ever materialize (at least, he\\'s not as scary as he *should* be).Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That\\'s fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement).

       "   'reviewText': '\"Ice Climer\", like \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Mario Bros.\" before it, is as simple arcade title that stars two Eskimos, Popo and Nana, who must climb vertical scrolling ice levels by shipping away at platforms in order to regain frozen vegetables that were stolen by a giant condor.  Nana and Popo are better known to modern games as they appear the wildely popular \"Super Smash Bros.\" franchise.  Along the way to regain their vegetables (perhaps a possible source for the vegetable themes in \"Super Mario Bros. 2/Doki Doki Panic\", as both games had the same programmer, Kazuaki Morita), the two Eskimos fight three main enemies: apolar bear, a Topi (a seal in the Japanese version and a Yeti in the Western version), and the Nitpicker.Ultimately, the most interesting thing about \"Ice Climber\" is that the programmer, Kazuaki Morita, considers this game a \"programming warm-up\" for his next project, which would turn out to be the immortal \"Super Mario Bros.\"  Morita went on to be a major programer for the \"Super Mario\" series, the \"Legend of Zelda\" series, and \"Star Fox.  After developing \"Ice Climber\", Morita was assigned as one of the main programmers for the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" The characters from \"Ice Climber\" would go on to feature in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series.According to Morita, the famous turtle cheat where you can get unlimited lives in \"Super Mario Bros.\" was actually an accident. He is also the principal reason why fishing was introduced into the \"Zelda\" series, as one of his passions is fishing.Both \"Ice Climber\" and \"NES Open Tournament Golf\" were directed by Kenji Miki, a long time producer for Nintendo.Although the game worked well if you look at it in the context of arcade games in the early 1980s (with simple titles like \"Defender\", \"Space Invaders\", the aforementioned \"Mario Bros.\" and \"Donkey Kong\", \"Pac Man\", \"Pong\", etc), today modern players will find the title rather simplistic.  Like several other early games in the video game canon, \"Ice Climbers\" would be a flash game in today\\'s market.  The game does feature 32 levels, which does give some replay value and needed length.Nintendo also released \"Ice Climber\" as part of the Classic NES series on the Gameboy Advance.  Although the game is undeniably fun, the initial listing price of twenty dollars for an NES game that is this simple is rather steep.  There are better titles in the Classic NES series.  This game would have been better served to be released in a complation of early NES classics featuring several other titles in conjunction with this, if Nintendo wanted to bring this to newer systems and still give consumers more bang for their buck.The video game website IGN rated this title as the 79th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play \"Moon Crystal\", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive.  The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo \"Ninja Gaiden\", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline.  Absolutely amazing! Had this been released in the US for the NES, I feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the NES canon).....------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As bonus content to the review proper, here is a portion of an interview with Morita from the official \"Zelda\" website from Nintendo around the time \"The Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess\" came about:\"The programming behind Nintendo\\'s games, and my own approach to it, has changed vastly since the mid 1980s. The first game that I programmed, Ice Climber, was my warm-up on the NES, then I dove into the fascinating task of working on the code for \\'Super Mario Bros\\'. And I had a real scare related to that project, which really taught me the importance of flawless code. Ever hear of the \"unlimited Mario\" cheat? The exact way to do it is a little complicated, but it involved the player setting up a scenario that allows Mario to bounce up and down on the same Koopa shell again and again and again. Points go up and up, leading to a steady flow of 1-Ups. I remember when we first heard about that cheat. We got a phone call from some kid, and Mr. Miyamoto and I both thought the call was a hoax--that such a thing was impossible! The programming was perfect . . . wasn\\'t it? Well, we verified that the cheat worked. Fortunately, very fortunately, the \"unlimited Mario\" cheat had a ton of PR value as word spread, because I sweated bullets over what might happen!\"\"Speaking of other groundbreaking projects, I still fondly recall how games like \\'Doki Doki Panic\\'--the foundation for \\'Super Mario Bros. 2\\' in North America--really stimulated my imagination as a programmer. That game was released for the Famicon Disk System in Japan, which--back in the day--was a truly fascinating system from a programming point of view. Of course, disk systems are common now, but then we were just exploring how the disk worked as an immense memory reservoir, which let me toy with many programming methods that I couldn\\'t do with ROM. Working with my design partner, and getting very little guidance from others, we developed \\'Doki Doki Panic\\' in ways that really pushed my skills. I really matured as a programmer during that time. Very interesting work.Looking back, I\\'m very fortunate to have been one of the main programmers working on almost every game in the \\'Zelda\\' series since it first began, since my programming has helped make \\'Zelda\\' such a part of history. Now it\\'s interesting to see how things have changed. While I used to do all of the programming for NES games, now I supervise a whole programming team, though I still do code myself, too, since I believe that staying very close to the art of programming is extremely important. Sometimes I feel myself thinking--when I see what some of the newer faces around Nintendo are conceiving--that such-and-such concept isn\\'t true \\'Zelda\\'! Listen to me! I have 20 years of experience here! But, really, having the fresh thoughts of young talents working on \\'Twilight Princess\\' has really opened my eyes, and that makes me remember those first days working with Mr. Miyamoto on the first \\'Zelda\\'. It\\'s always essential to keep your mind open and learn from new ideas. I\\'ve known Mr. Miyamoto for many, many years. It\\'s fascinating to watch him work now. On the surface, he looks like a perfectly pleasant middle-aged guy. But watch him make decisions! His words are extremely precise. His explanations carry a lot of weight. I never fail to be impressed by how he helps people grow and learn about game development. Which brings us back to \\'Twilight Princess\\'. As I prepare to cook in the kitchen, I\\'m seeing extraordinary ingredients coming my way. If our programming can bring all of these flavors together, and with our help also add a touch of light-world zest and dark-world grit as needed, you can bet that \\'Twilight Princess\\' will be the kind of memorable dish that will live up to the entire history of \\'Zelda\\'.\"',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'When people think of Zelda, they\\'re thinking one of two things: \"Oh boy, a new Zelda!\" or \"Oh boy. A new Zelda.\"  I found myself in the first camp as I anticipated what I thought would be a badass entry in my favorite series of games.  With Nintendo promising a more intricate overworld filled with puzzles that seamlessly flowed into dungeons, my mind raced, believing that the era of easy Zeldas designed with kids in mind was over.  What I got instead was a 40 hour fetchquest.I\\'ll probably spoil some stuff so watch it.Also, I got the version with the bundled controller.The controller is nice, and not as fingerprint hungry as the others.Enemies in General:I\\'ll be very blunt. There\\'s about 4 enemies that you\\'ll actually \"fight\" throughout the game. Bokoblins, Moblins, Stalfos, and Lizalfos.  They each come with different \"versions\" of themselves, basically reskinned and using a different weapon, for example the regular Lizalfos and the Dark Lizalfos. Regular ones shoot fire, Dark ones shoot \"cursed breath\" which induces the curse status, new to zelda, which leaves you unable to use weapons/items.  That\\'s about it, aside from the bosses.  Combat is basically finding the obvious weakspot, hitting there, waiting for the enemy to move around aimlessly for a bit, opening the weakspot again, and striking again.  All other enemies are ohko.  But seriously, 70% of what you fight is just bokoblins, with moblins coming in around 7/8th\\'s the way through the game. Every single Lizalfos I fought dropped a tail, and I have 12 of them. Not very many of those in comparison with the rest of the game.  There\\'s beamos here and there, deku babas, and keese too.Dungeons and Bosses:The bosses are pretty fun. You fight Ghirahim three times throughout, the second fight being the most fun.  This fact makes it so that there are less bosses overall, however, as he is the boss of the first and sixth dungeon.  The fourth boss is very very fun, throwing attacks at you and continually getting back up to wreck you.  The fifth boss and fifth dungeon are probably the best in the game with the boss and the setting leading up to and during the fight being really great and immersive.  The boss is a giant Kraken thing with one eye. The dungeon is actually a ship, and once you finish the dungeon and prepare for the boss, it starts to rumble. Giant tentacles begin to tear through the entire ship, leading you back up to the deck.  As I said, this makes for a really cool moment that immerses you completely within the game.  The seventh (and final) dungeon has no boss battle.  The seventh dungeon is however one of the more difficult parts of the game, and it is very enjoyable.  The final boss is absolutely pathetic.The first three dungeons were beyond easy.  Getting inside them was tougher than the actual dungeons.  And getting inside them was basically just, dowse, dowse, dowse, ok now you have gathered X amount of things you need in order to get inside the dungeon which was extremely annoying. Dowsing has you basically moving around your sword in first person mode trying to pinpoint the location of something. Dowsing was originally showcased as a replacement to the compass, but you can\\'t dowse inside dungeons. This continues to a lesser extent later on, but basically instead of exploring the game makes you waste time doing this.  There is not much to explore anyways, since the areas are extremely linear, as is the whole game.As an example, in the first area which is the woods, you have to find a bunch of Kikwis, which are the little tanooki looking creatures.  When you find them all, you go back to their boss which gives you the slingshot, which is required to enter the first dungeon.  Standard fare, but your first time doing this will undoubtedly take you longer than it should. It isn\\'t as seamless as they said.  When they said that, I imagined the world suddenly takes you through an area and you find a chest with a key inside and you realize, woah, I\\'m in dungeon! I thought I was still just outside! Nope.Controls and Items:I found that in trying to strike quickly, the control would often flip out and do the wrong thing.  For example, if an enemy has an opening that calls for you to strike in a downward and to the right position, and you try to quickly do this motion, more than likely you won\\'t be hitting it correctly, resulting in the enemy parrying or your attack bouncing off and then getting hit, as you leave yourself open.  This was with the actual control that game with the game, not a wii remote + attachment.  When done in a slow motion, it is accurate. So you have to wave gently in order to perform an attack. Doesn\\'t really feel like I\\'m attacking something.  1:1? I don\\'t think Nintendo knows what that means.  Additionally, it is laggy. It will not perform the movement the instant you do it unless you\\'re moving slowly.  I tested this between 60Hz and 120Hz, and it was definitely worse on the 60Hz (obviously).Flying and swimming are handled in the same manner, by holding the wii remote horizontally and adjusting direction by tilting and twisting.  Some may like this, some may not.  I enjoyed flying and swimming, but it became a bit cumbersome with the laggy response time.The shield mechanic is pretty solid.  You use the nunchuk to throw up your shield to reflect attacks, which normally gives you the chance to counterattack.  If you fail to perform it correctly though, it takes a chunk out of your shield\\'s \"life bar\" which eventually leads to it breaking.  The shield can be upgraded, but it is sort of pointless seeing as you get the chance to buy an improved shield every time you feel like upgrading it.Your other items work pretty spot on, even allowing you to recenter the aim with a press of down on the D-PAD. They all felt good to use, even though they didn\\'t get too much use aside from the beetle.  The Bow and Arrows are the last item you get making it a bit strange that you can\\'t use them to fight much through out the game.  I hardly used anything but the sword as a fighting weapon where as in previous zelda games I\\'d use almost everything but the sword.  The items are more spread out as well.  Items that we saw like the digging mitts are only useable in specific areas and are not assigned to your item wheel, but instead an equipped item, like a tunic would have been equipped in Ocarina of Time.  Your shield and bottles and nonessential items are stored in a secondary item wheel.  This can be seen as useful or not.  This is just a matter of personal opinion as I\\'m sure not everyone liked the huge item wheel from Twilight Princess.  This secondary item wheel can only carry four items initially, and must be upgraded by buying more pouches from Beedle in a majorly escalating price point.  The bomb bag and arrow quiver cannot be upgraded, but instead you can buy additional bags or quivers which hold an extra 5 units a piece.  These must go in your secondary item wheel, which can dissuade you from wanting them in the first place.  The game never leaves you without a patch of bomb flowers if you need them or without arrows if you cut the grass.  This same mechanic applies to the ignored slingshot.Plot:The majority of the time, when you get to an interesting plot point, you have to begin another fetch quest.  The biggest of these isSPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSthe forging of the Master Sword.  This negative point can be attributed to simple fanboy nerdrage, but let\\'s examine it anyways.  In prior Zelda games it is said that the Master Sword is a relic of the ancient Hylians, forged by sages as the blade of evil\\'s bane.  In this game, it is originally called the Goddess Sword, that the goddess Hylia creates in an intricate plot to destroy the game\\'s main villain who gets mentioned about once throughout the game until the very end.  Link has to, in a similar fashion to the also not very good Phantom Hourglass, gather 3 of something in order to turn the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword.  Once you do create it, you get an anti climatic \"MASTER LINK, YOU NOW HOLD THE MASTER SWORD.\" from Fi.  The creation of the Master Sword is retconned, and it is made in a way copied from PH.  Cool. Not. This also implies that the people in skyloft are not the Hylians in question from before, as there were people on the surface prior to them.The game also does not explain anything about the hylian crest (the red bird and the triforce) that is present on the shields.  You get the Hylian Shield in the game, with no mention of Hyrule or anything of the sort, but you see the emblem sans the head of the bird and the triforce all over the place though.As for characters, I didn\\'t delve too deeply into the sidequests as I wasn\\'t expecting a second helping of Majora\\'s Mask. The game lets you court several of the female NPC\\'s apparently though. Tsk tsk, cheating on zelda? Shame on you.  You get the standard serving of Zelda people with repeated dialogue and grunts with some comedy here and there, (mostly from Groose).Conclusion:Yes, I understand that all Zelda is is basically a fetchquest.  Going through three dungeons to get the Master Sword is nothing new.Going through three dungeons to FORGE the Master Sword is a problem, to me anyway.I can\\'t really continue with this as it\\'s basically all that needs to be said about this game.Is it worth the money?  Not really.  From what I\\'ve seen people are split and either love it or dislike it.The game\\'s length is artificially extended.I\\'ll probably get flamed for writing a negative review of it, but people, I\\'ve been making bacon bits out of Ganon since I was four.For me, this is the Other M of the Zelda series and a sign that maybe Nintendo isn\\'t going to be pumping out stuff like it used to.Maybe Groose was right. Maybe it should have been called \"The Legend of Groose.\"',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Okay so I bought a Wii, and Zelda was the must-have launch title, right? Wrong! To those who are crazy in love with this game, they are welcome to it. To all others, I say \"Don\\'t Believe the Hype.\"First, there\\'s the Wii control scheme. In the product description, it says:\"This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players \"pull back\" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote\\'s speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release.\"Okay, waving the sword does NOT make Link do the same move. That\\'s not even possible without the Wii Motion Plus. And \"pulling back\" an arrow? Since when? I never had to pull back on anything.This is obviously a Gamecube port. The Wii controls are tacked on. That\\'s okay though, because I love the Gamecube! But forget the controls. What about the actual gameplay?This game is very linear. And it holds your hand for far too long. I found that 10 hours into the game, I was still being tutored - for no reason. You\\'ll feel like one of the goats you get to herd in the game. Oh yes, the goat herding... You are Link, the awesome chosen hero. Who fights evil by herding goats.And that brings me to something else that drives me nuts about these newer Zelda games. Why is it that you have to spend HOURS doing stupid menial tasks at the beginning of the game? It\\'s a definite turnoff to any new player. I persevered, hoping it would get better. But after chasing monkeys and running from bees and finding a lost cat and reading dumb cut scenes involving a bunch of whiny kids, I kept thinking, \"For God\\'s sake, just give me a dang sword and let me get on with it already!\" It\\'s like Nintendo punishes you for wanting to fight by making you do a bunch of stupid stuff beforehand.PLEASE Nintendo, learn something here. Give people a sword AT THE BEGINNING. Throw them in the action, and let them figure it out as they go. I mean let\\'s face it, the story always boils down to collect all pieces of whatever in the dungeons and killing Gannon. Why make this complicated? What else is there to understand?But it\\'s not all bad. The graphics were wonderful. More along the lines of Ocarina of Time, and definitely an improvement over the Windwaker. But too bad Twilight Princess\\'s realistic landscape was completely populated by ridiculous, annoying, cartoony characters.I also liked the music, particularly during some of god scenes. Very well done.The use of the portals was very good. Definitely an improvement over Windwaker, where you used to set your sail then leave the room for an hour while you waited to finally get there. I was thankful for that!And I\\'ve got to say, the wolf concept was awesome. Playing as the wolf is one of the coolest things you get to do in the game. I really enjoyed that part. It\\'s too bad it is tainted somewhat by that stupid midget riding on your back.Which brings me to one of the worst things in the game: Midna. Never has a sidekick ever been so annoying. Do you like to be mocked and told what to do all the time? And her pseudo-Japanese baby-talk voice was awful. That got really obnoxious after a while. Why does Link need a sidekick, anyway? Can\\'t he just figure stuff out on his own like in the original NES Legend of Zelda?The dungeons were fun. Well designed, but a little too linear. You don\\'t really have any choice in how you beat them. There\\'s pretty much one path to take and once you\\'ve figured it out, that\\'s it.The gameplay was a major step back. Or a step down, if you will. The enemies were the worst. They were complete pushovers! In other games like Windwaker or Metroid: Prime, you get a sense of dread when a giant enemy fills the whole room and towers over you. Not in this game! Here, you can just laugh at them because you already know that you are going to beat them without dying once. I couldn\\'t believe how easy it was. At first I thought it was annoying that it took 5 pieces of heart to make a heart container instead of 4. Seemed like a lot of work. But in retrospect, why bother anyway? You\\'ll never need more than about 6 hearts to beat the toughest boss.Last night I finally realized that I\\'ve had it with this game. I had spent over an hour - AN HOUR! - literally searching for an ant. At that point I realized that I did not want to waste any more time on stupid side-quests and mini-games. I\\'m already over 40 hours into the game, and I\\'m wondering if it is ever going to end. I think I\\'ve got 3 dungeons left to go. But right now I\\'m not so sure that I can summon the will to continue. This game has a way of sucking the life out of you. But I am a POWER PLAYER, so I shall endure!GOOD:GraphicsMusicPlaying as a WolfBAD:Most obnoxious, annoying sidekick everGoat herdingSumo wrestling (has our hero really been reduced to this?)Menial tasksBORING cutscenesSmall world to explore, compared to other gamesEnemies are a total pushoverI wish I could recommend it, but I just can\\'t.

       "   'reviewText': 'The worst Nintendo console I\\'ve ever owned and I immediately sold it after a few months before anyone else found out what I found out about it and before it got any cheaper than it already was. The worst thing was that I got a KU version of the Wii which wasn\\'t backwards compatible with Nintendo GameCube games, controllers, or memory cards. I was so looking forward to it, judging by all the hype and positive things I heard, all the lies, I thought that I was going to finally enjoy a great gaming experience with fluent motion controls, but I was dead wrong. The Nintendo Wii is an underpowered, inferior console with graphics on par with it\\'s predecessor the Nintendo GameCube. Even with the component cable bringing it up to 480P it still looked like a generation before its time. This thing couldn\\'t even compete with the PS2 or Xbox let alone the PS3 and Xbox 360. When it came to graphics, gameplay, or anything else, the Wii was way behind.The gimmicky, HORRIBLE, ATROCIOUS, controls of the Wii Mote and Nunchuk are so awful that they\\'ve ruined games which had so much potential to become classic Nintendo titles. The thing that bothers me the most about the Wii is the few options available for controls. You HAVE to use the Wii Mote and Nunchuk for most games. The Classic Controller isn\\'t utilized for any of its \"good\" games and is mostly used with the virtual console games, not that the Classic Controller didn\\'t suck as well because it did and the GameCube controller was far superior and felt far more comfortable in my hands. The Wii classic controller is really small, has awkward placement of its buttons, is extremely light and feels like it was made from very cheap plastic with no rumble feature, the trigger buttons are awkward, the joysticks are weak and can easily break, and the DPad is stiff and gets stuck during gameplay. The Wii Classic Controller is complete garbage compared to the amazing Nintendo GameCube controller that came out years and years before it.If you have played The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess on the GameCube, than do not buy a Nintendo Wii and play the Wii version of that game. The Wii controls for Twilight Princess absolutely destroyed a somewhat decent Zelda title. In the Wii version of Twilight Princess you have to keep a floating fairy that corresponds to the position of the Wii Mote with the TV and Sensor Bar, dead center in the middle of the screen or else Link will walk off in another direction and you\\'ll constantly fall off annoying ledges and it will slow you down and reduce the quality of your game play significantly. It\\'ll also make your wrist tired from having to keep it constantly aimed at the center of the screen. I AM APPALLED BY THE AUDACITY, OF THOSE ADVERTISERS ON GAME TRAILERS AND IGN, WHO LIED OUT OF THEIR TEETH ABOUT THE NINTENDO Wii. They made the Wii appear to be something that it was the complete opposite of. They advertised Twilight Princess and made statements about how wonderful the Wii Mote controls are and how good it feels to swing a sword around. LIES! You don\\'t swing a sword around in Twilight Princess, you flick your wrist around and Link moves the sword in correspondence to a predetermined set of directions. The sword doesn\\'t move in the direction you aim it in, it goes in the directions the game aims it in, which is the same exact predetermined set of directions. Using the shield is also annoying because you have to punch with the Nunchuk and it doesn\\'t always work unlike the GameCube version where you press the R button to hit with the shield. Fishing becomes much more needlessly challenging and horseback riding is much worse all because of the Wii Mote and Nunchuk controls. Fishing doesn\\'t feel like fishing at all, despite the lies of the advertisers on IGN and Game Trailers. All you\\'re doing is reeling in the lure by rotating the Nunchuk in a circular motion with the annoying cord of the Nunchuk, I preferred the control stick and A button from the GameCube version. Horse back riding was also destroyed by the Wii Mote and Nunchuk since you have to keep the on screen fairy dead center in the middle of the screen or else the horse will move in another direction slowing you down and running you into obstacles and cliffs. Same thing when controlling the wolf.Super Smash Bros. Brawl is another major disappointment and without a doubt the worst addition to what was a decent fighting game series. Brawl is awful, especially when compared to the original Smash Bros. for the N64; and when compared to Smash Bros. Melee for the GameCube, Brawl is complete garbage. I recently got Brawl and was playing it on my recently purchased Wii U (which is another garbage console but I\\'m not here to review the Wii U). I had to pay $20 for a Mayflash Nintendo GameCube to Wii U controller adapter (which is another piece of garbage as well) just to play Brawl with \"decent\" controls because I was playing it with the Wii Mote earlier before this adapter arrived. It\\'s so unbelievably boring and I completely refuse to play through the subspace emissary, all you do is side scroll fighting weird creepy enemies that look like dolls stitched together from old throw pillows (Primid). The adventure mode in melee was much better and much cooler. There\\'s new characters in the game that are completely obscure and uninspired. All the problems that existed in Melee are back tenfold in this game like the clone characters (Ganondorf, Captain Falcon, Fox, Falco, Wolf, etc). Melee\\'s Link was much cooler since his design was based on the Ocarina of Time Link, Brawl\\'s Link is based on the very effeminate and wimpy looking Twilight Princess Link. The graphics hurt my eyes and I\\'m playing on a Plasma Screen 40 inch Samsung with the Wii U HDMI cable. The way Brawl plays just feels sluggish and slow. It feels like the frame rate has been downgraded immensely and slowed down from Melee. There\\'s no fun factor in Brawl, I\\'ve technically only played it for 1 day and I\\'m ready to sell my Wii U and everything that came with it. I thought for sure this would be the one decent playable Wii game, but it\\'s just as bad as all the others and I won\\'t sit through this abomination. Brawl is virtually unplayable, especially if you\\'ve experienced Melee or the original Smash Bros.; Brawl is a disgrace to the series.I was lied to about the Nintendo Wii and no one told me how terrible it really was, otherwise I would have never bought it. All the so called \"good\" games on the Wii turned out to be complete failures because of the awful Wii Mote and Nunchuk controls. When playing New Super Mario Bros. and Metroid Other M, the control is even worse than in other Wii games. You don\\'t use the Wii Mote and Nunchuk, you use the Wii Mote flipped on it\\'s side. It\\'s like playing with a remote controller, a thin remote control, using no joystick just a dpad. It isn\\'t fun and it\\'s a major step backwards from the GameCube controls. Had they given us the option to use a regular controller like any other video game console uses, those games could have been classics like the Wii version of Twilight Princess, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Skyward Sword, Metroid other M, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, New Super Mario Bros., etc. Instead, these games are virtually unplayable and will go down in history as Nintendo\\'s biggest disappointments to their true fan base.Using the internet browser in the Wii was one of the worst experiences I\\'ve ever had. It uses the crappy Opera internet browser and weak Flash Player Light. It was slow, sluggish, and lagged immensely even with a fast internet connection. The YouTube App is the worst version of a YouTube app I\\'ve ever seen on any electronic device. When searching for a video, it automatically spells the words for you and more often than not, it\\'s a word you didn\\'t intend to search for. It doesn\\'t show the correct search results anyway; even when you can manage to type in the words using the awful controls of the Wii remote. When typing in the words, you have to aim the Wii Mote at each character, you can\\'t use the Wii classic controller or plug in a keyboard, you can\\'t use the DPad from the Wii Mote or the control stick from the Nunchuk to select the characters. When aiming at the characters the Wii Mote vibrates with each character the pointer runs over. More often than not, you\\'ll accidentally select a character that you didn\\'t want because it\\'s so hard to get the pointer to focus on one single character and you won\\'t be able to simply backspace that single character to make a correction. Selecting backspace deletes the entire word and you have to type it all over again all because of a simple mistake. The search results are never correct, it never returns accurate search results and you can never see official music videos. I think there was some kind of copyright issue where Vevo won\\'t allow their videos to be seen on the Wii. The same thing happens with the P.S Vita (another garbage system) and its YouTube app and internet browser.Owning the Wii was the biggest disappointment of my life and all because of the lies and the over-hyping of the entire YouTube community. The entire YouTube community is guilty for making this garbage system seem like anything other than a glorified Nintendo GameCube with virtually unplayable controls that destroyed games with the potential of being classic Nintendo titles.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'I love The Legend of Zelda. I played, beat, and loved the Zeldas for the NES, SNES, and N64. I didn\\'t like Twilight Princess but Skyward Sword takes the cake as the worst Zelda game I have played to date. I will list my complaints as follows:1. The motion controls suck. There is no way to work with them. I have tried adjusting my wii-mote sensitivity, I have moved my sensor bar, I have tried other wii-motes, but the motion controls just suck. I haven\\'t been able to complete a number of side-quests because they don\\'t respond to how I move the controller. In the bamboo-cutting minigame I can hold the wii-mote perfectly level, pointing straight at the sensor bar, and swing it perfectly horizontally in perfect 30 degree arcs however Link will swing his sword diagonally, and then do a spin attack even though I left the nunchuck sitting on the ground. You can\\'t justify controls that suck this bad. Yes I might be able to beat the mini-game or side-quests after trying them over and over thousands of times, but it wouldn\\'t be a victory of skill, it would be a victory of dumb luck - and that\\'s all the stupid motion controls will let you have. Maybe Nintendo should fire their Japanese engineers and hire some Americans to make them some game controllers that actually WORK.2. Puzzles are mind-numbingly simple. If I can figure it out in less than 30 seconds you just weren\\'t trying hard enough. One particular puzzle in the pirate ship just irked me - you enter a room with a massive shaft of light coming down from the ceiling. Before I could even move, stupid Fi comes out and tells me that she can see the crystal on the roof through the hole in the ceiling. WHY? It would have taken me 5 seconds to figure that out, but now that you\\'ve gone and told me how to solve it, I can\\'t even derive any enjoyment out of solving it! The puzzles are stupid, and anytime you get one that requires real thinking, they tell you how to do it!3. I hate the golden harp. I loved the Ocarina in OoT - there were so many songs you could play, and you could even make your own! In particular I loved playing the Song of Storms inside the windmill, and watching the dude with the music box freak out. However instead of improving upon that game mechanic, they chose to simplify it. The harp has no notes and you can only strum it back and forth, and doesn\\'t create anything I could describe as \"music\". All of the \"songs\" in this game sound so deafeningly horrible to my ears that I turn the volume down during music sequences. This is coming from someone who enjoys listening to Classical.4. Fi is ugly. I normally enjoy seeing/playing female game characters and seeing them in many different graphics and art styles. However Fi just creeps me out. When she talks her mouth opens and closes like a ventriloquist\\'s doll, which just makes the singing sequences scare the crap out of me. Also what is up with her outfit? I don\\'t mind if a girl wears fishnet, but Fi is wearing laced-together jumper cables. Ugly, ugly, UGLY!So far I have put over 100 hours into Skyward Sword and I think it is the worst in the series by far. Nintendo needs to buck up and make something that surpasses OoT, which I think they are capable of doing but they need to put some effort into it, and this game just seems like a half-hearted entry into the series.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'The bottom line is Eiji Anouma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi couldn\\'t direct a decent Zelda game to save their lives.Skyward Sword is absolute 110% proof positive that for the Zelda series to get back on track and \"be all it can be\" to borrow the old army slogan its going to need its original creators who understand it like no one else on this earth to re-unite and write and direct it, those creators of course being Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, Miyamoto who was influenced in the series creation by the Tom Cruise movie \"Legend\" and his own childhood experiences and Mr. Tezuka being a fan of Tolkien and Lord Of The Rings as per his inspiration in the creation of the Zelda series.Lastly the series perhaps even more than needing its two original creators to return needs one of its most talented writers to return that of course being Yoshiaki Koizumi who was on the writing team for both Link To The Past and Ocarina Of Time the two best games as of yet in the Zelda series.Zelda must return to it\\'s midieval sword and sorcery roots that are combined with a whimsical light hearted overall feel of heroism, destiny and high adventure for the series to once again thrive, ever since Eiji Anouma took it down the path of weirdness with the awful and inappropriate for the series Majora\\'s Mask (which was a different game entirely that simply featured Link) the series has been sliding downhill straight into the gutter of mediocrity.Nintendo simply needs to learn to create a compelling Hyrule again and stop with the gimmick ripoff worlds of Kevin Costner\\'s Water World ala The Wind Waker, or the Star Wars Bespin/Avatar ripoff world of Skyloft and sit down and figure out how to make a huge world of Hyrule filled with things to do in it, a world which features plenty of trees, green grass, beautiful streams and lakes and plenty of hidden Zelda Hylian lore. As a Zelda fan I am interested in Hyrule\\'s story NOT that of a gimmick world or an alternate weirdo world like Majora\\'s Mask\\'s Termina but HYRULE.To get to my review of this present game in the series...Skyward Sword deceptively starts out strong, finally Link and Zelda are to have some depth added to their characters via the featuring of anything resembling an actual coherent story being put into place for once namely its a love story featuring the two beloved Zelda characters the kind of which fans have been begging the out of touch Nintendo company to create for years since the opportunity was quite clearly missed with Ocarina Of Time\\'s story and ending.Many fans of that game wanted to see Link and Zelda become romantically involved and even dare I say kiss eachother at it\\'s ending.Well that was a missed opportunity in a sea of Nintendo\\'s missed opportunities due to Nintendo being so thoroughly arrogant, set in their ways and completely out of touch with their fanbase.Anyway once Skyward Sword gets going you have to go rescue your bird known as a \"Loftwing\" from a pack of bullies and the overall beginning feel of the game due to it\\'s highschool type of setting somewhat is reminiscent of Rockstar\\'s game \"Bully\" though this being Nintendo and being yet another step back for the Zelda series down the kiddy route ala Wind Waker don\\'t expect much juvenile hijinks or entertainment of the riske sort that would put a little spark into the otherwise dull school environment of Skyloft.Such would remove the game\\'s kiddy \"E for everyone\" rating and make it less palatable for the soccer moms, toddlers and the senior citizen set who comprise Nintendo\\'s apparent chosen demographic for this game.Collectibles- gold remote is nice and had a new grainy feel when I first began using it, as for the 25th anniversary Zelda symphony CD? *Gag* I thought the music orchestrated sounded like garbage.Controls- horrible and in need of constant recalibration and re-centering though if you listen to the lies of the Nintendo fanboy reviewers and Nintendo shills across the web the controls are put across as though they are god\\'s gift to gaming.*Blech!*Bomb bowling is probably the worst and most wonky of the controls. Sword controls you can usually waggle your way to victory on just about every enemy save for the man eating plants so they\\'re not a game breaker but their lack of cohesion is unsettling since Nintendo is widely claimed by it\\'s fanbase to be the greatest gaming company of all time with the best controls and focus on quality of all gaming companies ever. Well perhaps they were at one time but if one is honest while playing this game one can see that Nintendo has quite clearly lost it\\'s touch in this regard or at least with this particular game series of theirs.The gadgets and system for utilizing them are probably the only bright spot here along with the Beetle which compared to the rest of the system seems to control near flawlessly.Linearity- perhaps the single worst encompassing overall problem with this game is its linearity which is to say its point A to point B nature. Zelda games should be as non linear as possible like the very first entry in the series on the NES and to a lesser extent Ocarina Of Time. Zelda games should ideally be a total sandbox world that lets you take on whatever dungeon you want to finish first at any time and explore all areas in the world that you want at any time as they should all immediately be open for doing that. In Skyward Sword you have to open up each new area in fixed linear succession. This was really a huge step backwards for the Zelda series and puts it on par with other sub par shovelware games.Graphics- a step back from Twilight Princess\\'s more mature and dark style down the kiddy Disney route of Wind Waker (yet again) and aside from the game\\'s art style the graphical quality is simply so poor in overrall quality when compared to titles in the same genre on superior consoles such as Skyrim you could almost believe you were playing an N64 game its so bad. The game has a very washed out look overall. That said at least Link and Zelda are dressed nicely for this one featuring perhaps Link\\'s best pre-green tunic costume in a Zelda game to date.Music- great in Skyloft and it\\'s surrounding cloud island areas, and especially magnificent during the scene where you have to follow your guide \"Fi\" to retrieve the Goddess Sword but still overrall the music is ultimately very kiddy and Disney-esque which is a step back for the series akin to the abysmal Wind Waker offering.The music in the three main worlds below the clouds is underwhelming to horrible especially in the volcano area and by horrible I mean simply inappropriate for the Zelda series, I can only describe the volcano area\\'s music as goony stupid fratboy sounding music something that could\\'ve served well as the Grouse character\\'s theme yet still not something you\\'d expect to or even want to hear in a game series that is supposed to be an epic midieval sword and sorcery adventure.Game world- empty in the sky and constricted and boring down below the clouds, this is NOT Ocarina Of Time\\'s Hyrule field that even though mostly empty itself still had far more charm and appeal than this game\\'s three boring areas due to it\\'s freedom and cohesiveness as one fixed and full land mass of game operating terrain for you to stomp over with your horse and explore till your heart\\'s content. Skyward Sword\\'s grass area by contrast simply feels boring, dull and constricting and the washed out graphics and ridiculous dumbed down kiddy yelping red colored enemies don\\'t help matters either.Boss Battles- amazing, probably among the very few good things about this overall underwelming Zelda game along with the Link and Zelda romance and a select few great music tracks.Story- the Link and Zelda romance is great and long wished for by the fanbase but I don\\'t appreciate Ganon not being in the game as it\\'s final boss as I am a Zelda fan first and foremost and Ganon\\'s story is intregal to the Zelda series in my opinion, I also don\\'t appreciate Nintendo attempting to shove political correctness down my throat by featuring in Ganon\\'s place an obvious flaming homosexual with a diamond in his ear named \"Ghirahim\" who confirms his particular alternative lifestyle by the suggestive grabbing of Link\\'s \"sword\" during his boss battle and who sneaks up behind Link and waggles his tongue behind Link\\'s ear in a very sexually suggestive manner for a game thats supposedly being marketed to everyone which means children as well as adults.Characters- utterly forgetabble save for Grouse who much like Ghirahim (the openly flaming homosexual boss character) is shoved down our collective throats in one ridiculously kiddy scene after the next. Though perhaps the most detestably kiddy thing about this game other than its watered down washed out cartoony graphics are the despicably kiddy mother and father characters from the Bizarre the shop of the game\\'s main hub area of Skyloft. The mother makes a ridiculously stupid and annoying near constant hand clapping and yells out \"hey yo!\" so much you\\'d think she was a Scott Hall fan of professional wrestling fame and his group the \"New World Order\" and the father is holding a baby on his back and making stupid and annoying sounds which I can only describe as sounding like a dying turkey might sound. He does this I believe out of a desire to amuse the baby on his back that is probably crying in the first place due to his father\\'s stupid attempt at calming him down along with his mother\\'s idiotic sound effects. So overall the scene in the Bizarre alone undoubtably confirms this games overwhelmingly kiddy nature. Its almost more disgustingly contemptably kiddy than The Wind Waker due to this utter stupidity going on in the Bizarre.There is also the disturbingly disgusting aspect of she-male transgender characters being placed in the game and no I\\'m NOT joking here. The fortune teller has a grotesquely obese female body and is clearly a female but has a mustasche and the Pumpkin soup restaurant/bar owner appears to be dressed like a woman and has a woman\\'s hairstyle but is also sporting a large mustache. Its thoroughly disgusting that Nintendo has rated this game E for everyone which means children can play it as well as adults when it features such strong political and social messages such as the approval of the homosexual lifestyle and transgender lifestyle choices. I wouldn\\'t see the need to point this out to parents if this game were rated M for mature but it is not. Its rated E for everyone despite having these disturbing and seemingly politically motivated themes.Enemies- most can be waggled through to victory, some can\\'t, overall so-so, I\\'d prefer future Zelda games go darker with the enemies have more knights in armor to fight and do away with that idiotic piano music or whatever plays while you strike enemies that started with the awful Wind Waker title and carried over to Skyward Sword. Also Nintendo should get rid of the stupid cartoon purple smoke and lame explosion sound effect and either go the mature sword slashing creates blood from enemies route and clanking steel sound effects of sword on steel armor ala Bethesda\\'s Skyrim or return to the sound effects of OOT and MM along with enemies simply evaporating and maybe leaving behind rupees and items as they did in those past games as well. The Wind Waker kiddyness and stupidity needs to be left behind for the Zelda series to progress and move forward. Also remove the stupid triangle among targeted enemies heads. Its unnecessary, kiddie and totally lame as is the accompanying sound effect. Try again Nintendo.Overall score for this Zelda game in my view: 7.5So its a semi-good game and worth at least one playthrough which is about all I think anyone will be able to stomach due to it\\'s poor controls, boring feel, ugly eyesore washed out kiddie graphics and total linearity so feel free to rent or borrow this one if you\\'re a casual gamer.Hardcore Zelda fans will get this one regardless just to complete their Zelda library.It is definitely NOT the best Zelda game ever made and certainly not an experience to rival or even top Ocarina Of Time, to borrow a quote of Obi Wan Kenobi \"This is NOT the Zelda game you\\'re looking for\".So indeed the Zelda series is sick and dying and only Shigeru Miyamoto, Takashi Tezuka and Yoshiaki Koizumi can save it.',\n",
